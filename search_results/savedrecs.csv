Methods: Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the baseline risk factors for stroke. The proportion of treatment effect (PTE) explained by on-treatment LDL-C levels was estimated. Results: In 7832 patients at risk, a total of 99 strokes were observed during the 5-year follow-up period. Significant relationships were observed between stroke and traditional risk factors such as male sex, advanced age, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. In the pravastatin group, hazard ratio (HR) for stroke adjusted by on-treatment lipid level was lower than the unadjusted value versus control (HR [95%CI], 0.48 [0.26-0.87] and 0.59 [0.38-0.92], respectively)-giving a negative PTE of - 38.6% and suggesting that the risk reduction could not be explained by LDL-C lowering alone. Conclusions: Male sex, aging, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-C, high Lp(a), obesity, and smoking were determined as risk factors for stroke in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia, and the observed risk reduction could not be explained by pravastatin's LDL-C-lowering effect alone, suggesting pleiotropic effects.

This three-armed RCT assessed the effects of one-year soy isoflavone (ISF) intervention on mammographic density (MD) change among healthy peri- and postmenopausal Malaysian women. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03686098). Participants were randomized into the 100 mg/day ISF Supplement, 50 mg/day ISF Diet, or control arm, and assessed for change in absolute and relative dense area from digital mammograms conducted at enrolment and after 12 months, compared over time across study arms using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Out of 118 women enrolled, 91 women completed the intervention, while 27 women (23%) were lost in follow up. The ISF supplement arm participants observed a larger decline in dense area (-1.3 cm(2)), compared to the ISF diet (-0.5 cm(2)) and control arm (-0.8 cm(2)), though it was not statistically significant (p = 0.48). Notably, among women enrolled within 5 years of menopause; dense area declined by 6 cm(2) in the ISF supplement arm, compared to <1.0 cm(2) in the control arm (p = 0.13). This RCT demonstrates a possible causal association between soy ISF intake and MD, a biomarker of breast cancer risk, among Asian women around the time of menopause, but these findings require confirmation in a larger trial.","[Rajaram, Nadia; Yap, Beverley; Mariapun, Shivaani; Tan, Lee Mei; Yip, Cheng Har; Ho, Weang Kee; Teo, Soo Hwang] Canc Res Malaysia, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia; [Eriksson, Mikael; Hall, Per] Karolinska Inst, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sa'at, Hamizah; Taib, Nur Aishah Mohd; Teo, Soo Hwang] Univ Malaya Canc Res Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ho, Evelyn Lai Ming] Ramsay Sime Darby Healthcare, ParkC Med Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 52200, Malaysia; [Khor, Geok Lin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Yip, Cheng Har] Ramsay Sime Darby Healthcare, Subang Jaya Med Ctr, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia; [Ho, Weang Kee] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Appl Math, Semenyih 43500, Malaysia; [Hall, Per] Soder Sjukhuset, S-11883 Stockholm, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of Nottingham Malaysia; Sodersjukhuset Hospital,"Teo, SH (corresponding author), Canc Res Malaysia, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia.;Teo, SH (corresponding author), Univ Malaya Canc Res Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",soohwang.teo@cancerresearch.my,"; Sa'at, Hamizah/K-6265-2016; Abdul Taib, Nur Asheila/AGS-1681-2022; li, bing/HTS-1845-2023; Teo, Soo Hwang/KAM-3140-2024; Rajaram, Nadia/IVV-8482-2023; Ho, Evelyn/MSW-9117-2025","Rajaram, Nadia/0000-0002-8469-8332; Sa'at, Hamizah/0000-0001-6173-7127; Ho, Evelyn Lai Ming/0000-0002-4900-610X; eriksson, mikael/0000-0001-8135-4270; Khor, Geok Lin/0000-0002-4691-6319; HO, WEANG KEE/0000-0002-8269-7344; Teo, Soo/0000-0002-0444-590X",Sime Darby Ladies Pro Golf Tournament; Estee Lauder Group of Companies; Yayasan Sime Darby; Yayasan PETRONAS,Sime Darby Ladies Pro Golf Tournament; Estee Lauder Group of Companies; Yayasan Sime Darby; Yayasan PETRONAS,"This work was supported by charitable funds from the Sime Darby Ladies Pro Golf Tournament held in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the Estee Lauder Group of Companies, Yayasan Sime Darby, and Yayasan PETRONAS.

However, these interventions are often developed using the theories and/or intuitions of the individuals who developed them and evaluated in isolation without comparing their efficacy with other interventions. Here, we make the case for an experimental design that addresses such issues: an intervention tournament-that is, a study that compares several different interventions against a single control and uses the same standardized outcome measures during assessment and participants drawn from the same population. We begin by highlighting the utility of intervention tournaments as an approach that complements other, more commonly used approaches to addressing societal issues. We then describe various approaches to intervention tournaments, which include crowdsourced, curated, and in-house-developed intervention tournaments, and their unique characteristics. Finally, we discuss practical recommendations and key design insights for conducting such research, given the existing literature. These include considerations of intervention-tournament deployment, characteristics of included interventions, statistical analysis and reporting, study design, longitudinal and underlying psychological mechanism assessment, and theoretical ramifications.","[Hameiri, Boaz] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Program Conflict Resolut & Mediat, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Moore-Berg, Samantha L.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Tel Aviv University; University of Pennsylvania,"Hameiri, B (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Program Conflict Resolut & Mediat, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Moore-Berg, SL (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bhameiri@tauex.tau.ac.il; samantha.mooreberg@asc.upenn.edu,,,Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1590/20],Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation),This work was supported by Israel Science Foundation (ISF) Grant 1590/20 (awarded to B.

OBJECTIVE: In this post-hoc analysis of the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) Study, a large-scale primary prevention trial with pravastatin, we examined the preventive effect of pravastatin on the future development of hypertension in patients with hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: Of the overall (MEGA) Study population, 3397 nonhypertensive patients at baseline were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly assigned to either the diet alone group (n = 1722) or the diet plus pravastatin group (n = 1675) and then were followed-up for a median of 36 months to determine new-onset hypertension. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 1595 patients developed hypertension (49.1% in the diet alone group and 44.7% in the diet plus pravastatin group). After adjusting for multiple covariates, the diet plus pravastatin group showed a 10% reduction in the risk of developing hypertension (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.998), compared with the diet alone group. Subgroup analyses revealed that the preventive effect of pravastatin on the development of hypertension was pronounced in patients aged years, men, those with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus and those without obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin reduced the risk of developing hypertension in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. The risk reduction of cardiovascular disease with statins could be partly explained by their preventive effect on the development of hypertension. (C) 2017 National Lipid Association.

Specifically, we partnered with the nonprofit educational platform Zearn Math to compare the impact of 15 different interventions with a reminder-only megastudy control condition. All 16 conditions entailed weekly emails delivered to teachers over 4-wk in the fall of 2021. The best-performing intervention, which encouraged teachers to log into Zearn Math for an updated report on how their students were doing that week, produced a 5.06% increase in students' math progress (3.30% after accounting for the winner's curse). In exploratory analyses, teachers who received any behaviorally informed email nudge (vs. a reminder-only megastudy control) saw their students' math progress boosted by an average of 1.89% during the 4-wk intervention period; emails referencing personalized data (i.e., classroom-specific statistics) outperformed emails that did not by 2.26%. While small in size, these intervention effects were consistent across school socioeconomic status and school type (public, private, etc.) and, further, persisted in the 8-wk post-intervention period. Collectively, these findings underscore both how difficult it is to change behavior and the need for large-scale, rigorous, empirical research of the sort undertaken in this megastudy.","[Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Duckworth, Angela L.; Milkman, Katherine L.] Univ Penn, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ko, Ahra; Kay, Joseph S.; Gromet, Dena M.; Halpern, Aden; Jung, Youngwoo; Paxson, Madeline K.; Zumaran, Ramon A.

The mathematical and statistical literature does not address questions such as how one should seed teams in a tournament or which tournament structures are appropriate. For double-elimination (DE) tournaments even basic questions such as how many structures there are remain unanswered. This article addresses some fundamental questions concerning DE tournaments, including the number of DE tournaments and the probabilities of teams winning a DE tournament. Edwards gives many results about single-elimination (SE) tournaments, such as the probability of winning an SE tournament and a notation for labeling and counting them.

We conducted a megastudy (n = 32,059 participants) testing 25 treatments designed by academics and practitioners to reduce Americans' partisan animosity and antidemocratic attitudes. We find that many treatments reduced partisan animosity, most strongly by highlighting relatable sympathetic individuals with different political beliefs or by emphasizing common identities shared by rival partisans. We also identify several treatments that reduced support for undemocratic practices-most strongly by correcting misperceptions of rival partisans' views or highlighting the threat of democratic collapse-which shows that antidemocratic attitudes are not intractable. Taken together, the study's findings identify promising general strategies for reducing partisan division and improving democratic attitudes, shedding theoretical light on challenges facing American democracy.","[Voelkel, Jan G.] Cornell Univ, Brooks Sch Publ Policy, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Stagnaro, Michael N.; Cashman, Matthew; Yoeli, Erez; Rand, David G.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chu, James Y.] Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pink, Sophia L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mernyk, Joseph S.; Redekopp, Chrystal; Willer, Robb] Stanford Univ, Dept Sociol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ghezae, Isaias; Cikara, Mina; Greene, Joshua] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Adjodah, Dhaval] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Allen, Levi G.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Allis, L.

Here, we attempted to identify such cues using a corpus analysis and to examine their impact on human performance in a megastudy in which participants ( N = 45) assigned stress to nonwords ( N = 800), stimuli particularly revealing of stress cue use because they have no predefined stress pattern. Hierarchical regression results confirmed an impact of sublexical cues examined in former studies and revealed a role for cues not previously examined, including similarity to real words. These results are informative for computational models of reading as they indicate that readers assign stress to nonwords based on not only sublexical but also lexical information.","[Spinelli, Giacomo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Trettenero, Sonia; Colombo, Lucia] Univ Padua, Padua, Italy; [Lupker, Stephen J.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [Spinelli, Giacomo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Psicol, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, MI, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Padua; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Milano-Bicocca,"Spinelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Psicol, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, MI, Italy.",giacomospinelli@hotmail.it,"Spinelli, Giacomo/AFE-8498-2022",,"Grant DOR (Dotazione Ordinaria per Ricerca, Universita degli Studi di Padova, year 2019); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [A6333]; Ontario Trillium Scholarship","Grant DOR (Dotazione Ordinaria per Ricerca, Universita degli Studi di Padova, year 2019); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ontario Trillium Scholarship","This research was partially supported by Grant DOR (Dotazione Ordinaria per Ricerca, Universita degli Studi di Padova, year 2019) to Lucia Colombo, by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Grant A6333 to Stephen J.

We designed an experiment to collect data on charitable donations made by participants out of their earnings from a real-effort tournament. We varied the earnings associated with ranks across our treatments thereby allowing us to observe donations by participants who end up at different ranks but have the same earnings. Prior to finding out how well they performed, participants were also asked to report their expected rank. Controlling for differences in effort and earnings, participants who were ranked first donated significantly more than others, supporting the view that positive affect from winning may increase generosity. However, we find that this effect diminishes when the difference between realised and expected ranks are controlled for, lending support to the idea that positive surprise from winning also increases generosity.

Although much is known about those who participate in fishing tournaments in terms of their fishing motivations, attitudes, and characteristics, much less is known at the angler population level regarding their preferences for tournament opportunities. Using a stated preference choice model with hypothetical scenarios to simulate participation choices and understand preferences, study objectives were to identify angler preferences for various types of tournament fishing products. Four tournament policy characteristics were investigated: promotion of catch and release, bait restrictions, whether a percentage of the tournament entrance fee should go to support fishery management activities, and whether a tournament should be a nonprofit or profit-making venture. Three expectation attributes were inserted: tournament size, trip cost per day, and whether a tournament is family friendly. We sent seven different versions of the mail questionnaire to 1,633 anglers. Of 795 returns, 648 were used for estimating conditional logit models. Analysis indicated that a scenario with no management interventions was not most preferred. Anglers most preferred a conservation-oriented option that introduced additional management measures. Overall, scenarios with management interventions were more favored than the status quo situation (with no management interventions). Although respondents showed reluctance to adopt other management-related options, results generally indicated they were increasingly concerned with sustainability of fish stocks and potential conflicts between tournament and nontournament users and preferred tournament products that reflect these concerns.","Clemson Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Coastal Fisheries Div, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Clemson University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Oh, CO (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",chiokoh@clemson.edu,,,,,,,49,16,18,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Employees could either offer a high effort level or engage in sabotage to advance their relative position in the tournament. Since directing the sabotage against one's opponent could guarantee advancement, and destructive action was found to be a less costly method to improve one's position in the tournament compared with effort, the results showed that sabotaging was rampant when the wage differential between the winner and the loser was high. As sabotage was mainly induced by the perception that it can improve one's chances of winning the prize, this perception was diminished in the three-player tournament. In this treatment, the saboteur not only helped himself through sabotaging, but also other co-workers. The saboteur might receive sabotage from another co-worker, which caused both saboteurs to suffer a low payoff. When employees were not assured that sabotaging could help them win the prize, they competed with effort and the destructive activities were significantly reduced. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In a game-theoretical model with three contestants, we compare fixed-prize tournaments with tournaments where prizes depend on contestants' joint output. Our analysis suggests that the incentives to sabotage in a fixed-prize tournament may be counteracted in a variable-prize tournament such that contestants no longer sabotage, but help one another. We empirically test the implications of our model with the help of a classroom experiment where we compare participants' choices in a fixed-prize treatment (FP) with those of a variable-prize treatment (VP) in a between-subjects design. Given our parametrization, we expect efforts to be identical in both treatments, and we expect sabotage in the FP treatment and no sabotage in the VP treatment. In accordance with the model, we find that participants in the fixed-prize tournament sabotage one another, whereas participants in the variable-prize tournament help one another. At the same time, participants' effort levels do not vary between the two treatments.","[Gloekler, Thomas] Baden Wuerttemberg Cooperat State Univ Loerrach, Fac Econ, Hang Str 46-50, D-79539 Lorrach, Germany; [Pull, Kerstin; Stadler, Manfred] Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Naukler Str 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Pull, K (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Naukler Str 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",kerstin.pull@uni-tuebingen.de,"Pull, Kerstin/AEA-1913-2022","Pull, Kerstin/0000-0002-7682-3703",Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tubingen,Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tubingen,We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tubingen.,,18,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4336,,GAMES-BASEL,Games,OCT,2022,13,5,,,,,,,65,10.3390/g13050065,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/g13050065,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,5P3OW,,gold,,,7/25/25,WOS:000873064900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cumulative effect of stressful stimuli was noticeable especially at the end of the day. The results of the present study indicate the usefulness of using tools and a way to study stress among coaches. A similar research protocol can be used to assess stress responses to single-day stimuli associated with other social and occupational roles in healthy middle-aged men. Background: Watching athletic tournaments induces emotional and physiological responses in sports fans and coaches. The aim of the study was to investigate hormonal and cardiovascular responses in judo coaches observing the fights of their athletes during one-day, high-level tournaments. Material and methods: We studied the biological responses of a group of seventeen judo club coaches between the ages of 39 and 57 years to a one-day judo tournament attended by the adult male and/or female athletes that they coached. At the time of the tournaments and also in neutral conditions, the coaches' capillary blood and saliva samples were collected concurrently two times a day, both at 7:30 a.m. and after completion of the tournament (at about 8:00 p.m.). Cardiovascular parameters were also determined at the same times of day. Sleep quality (SQ) was assessed on a 6-point scale both on the night preceding the tournament and in neutral conditions. Cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) levels were determined from serum and saliva samples. The results for both days at different times of day were compared. Results: Statistical calculations showed higher concentrations of cortisol and a greater reduction of testosterone levels in serum and saliva at the end of the day during the tournament compared with those on a neutral day. Morning and evening cardiovascular indices were higher during the tournament. Conclusion: The study showed that during one-day tournaments, judo coaches were exposed to stress that induced intermittent hormonal changes in blood and saliva and activated the autonomic nervous system.","[Obminski, Zbigniew] Natl Res Inst, Dept Endocrinol, Inst Sport, PL-01982 Warsaw, Poland; [Supinski, Jan; Blach, Wieslaw] Univ Sch Phys Educ, Fac Phys Educ & Sport, PL-51612 Wroclaw, Poland; [Rydzik, Lukasz; Ozimek, Mariusz; Ambrozy, Tadeusz] Univ Phys Educ, Inst Sports Sci, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland; [Cynarski, Wojciech J.] Univ Rzeszow, Coll Med Sci, Inst Phys Culture Studies, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Borysiuk, Zbigniew] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Phys Educ & Physiotherapy, PL-45040 Opole, Poland",Institute of Sport - National Research Institute; University of Rzeszow; Opole University of Technology,"Rydzik, L (corresponding author), Univ Phys Educ, Inst Sports Sci, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland.",zbigniew.obminski@insp.waw.pl; jan.supinski@awf.wroc.pl; lukasz.gne@op.pl; ela_cyn@wp.pl; mariusz.ozimek@awf.krakow.pl; z.borysiuk@po.edu.pl; wieslaw.blach@awf.wroc.pl; tadek@ambrozy.pl,"; Ozimek, Mariusz/HSF-1182-2023; Rydzik, Łukasz/AAZ-6020-2020; Ambroży, Tadeusz/AAZ-4796-2021","Ambrozy, Tadeusz/0000-0001-7361-9478; Rydzik, Lukasz/0000-0001-7956-7488; Cynarski, Wojciech J./0000-0003-1252-5456; Ozimek, Mariusz/0000-0002-9282-5725;",,,,,47,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,JUN,2022,11,6,,,,,,,828,10.3390/biology11060828,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11060828,,,10,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,2K2HN,35741349,"gold, Green Published",,,7/25/25,WOS:000816163800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little information exists on the effectiveness of these strategies to minimize muscle damage, or any impact they may have on biomarker clearance after team sport competition. The main aim of this study was to investigate the time course of muscle damage markers and inflammatory cytokines during basketball tournament play. We also wished to examine if cold water immersion and compression recovery strategies ameliorate any post-game increases of these biomarkers, compared with traditional refuelling and stretching routines. Male basketball players (age 19.1 years, s=2.1; height 1.91 m, s=0.09; body mass 87.9 kg, s=15.1) were asked to compete in a three-day tournament playing one game each day. Players were assigned to one of three recovery treatments: carbohydrate+stretching (control, n=9), cold-water immersion at 11 degrees C for 5x1 min (n=10); or full-leg compression at 18 mmHg for similar to 18 h (n=10). Players received their treatment after each game on three consecutive days. Venous blood samples were assayed before the tournament and at 10 min, 6 h, and 24 h after each game for concentrations of the muscle damage markers fatty-acid binding protein (FABP), creatine kinase, and myoglobin; interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were also assayed. Inferences were based on log-transformed concentrations. Post-game increases in damage markers were clear and very large for FABP after the cold water immersion (3.81 x/divided by 1.19, factor mean x/divided by factor s), compression (3.93 x/divided by 1.46), and control (4.04 x/divided by 1.19) treatments. Increases in myoglobin were also clear and very large after the cold water immersion (3.50 x/divided by 1.35), compression (3.66 x/divided by 1.48), and control (4.09 x/divided by 1.18) treatments. Increases in creatine kinase were clear but small after the cold water immersion (1.30 x/divided by 1.03), compression (1.25 x/divided by 1.39), and control (1.42 x/divided by 1.15) treatments, with small or unclear differences between treatments. There were clear moderate to large post-game increases in IL-6 for cold water immersion (2.75 x/divided by 1.37), compression (3.43 x/divided by 1.52), and control (3.47 x/divided by 1.49). Increases in IL-10 were clear and moderate for cold water immersion (1.75 x/divided by 1.43), but clear and large after the compression (2.46 x/divided by 1.79) and control (2.32 x/divided by 1.41) treatments. Small decreases in IL-6 and IL-10 were observed with cold water immersion compared with the compression and control treatments, with unclear effects between treatments over the tournament. There was no clear benefit from any recovery treatment post-game, as the differences between treatments for all biomarker measures were small or unclear. Pre- to post-tournament increases in FABP, myoglobin, and creatine kinase were clearly small to moderate. There were also small to moderate differences between cold water immersion and the compression (0.85 x/divided by 1.21) and control (0.76 x/divided by 1.26) treatments for the post-tournament measures compared with pre-tournament. Pre- to post-tournament changes for IL-6 and IL-10 were unclear, as were the differences between treatments for both cytokines. Tournament basketball play elicits modest elevations of muscle damage markers, suggesting disruption of myocyte membranes in well-trained players. The magnitude of increase in muscle damage markers and inflammatory cytokines post-game ranged from small for creatine kinase, to large for IL-6 and IL-10, to very large for FABP and myoglobin. Cold water immersion had a small to moderate effect in decreasing FABP and myoglobin concentrations after a basketball tournament compared with the compression and control treatments.","[Montgomery, Paul G.; Pyne, David B.; Cox, Amanda J.] Australian Inst Sport, Dept Physiol, Belconnen, ACT 2616, Australia; [Hopkins, Will G.] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Sport & Recreat, Auckland, New Zealand; [Minahan, Clare L.] Griffith Univ, Gold Coast, Australia; [Hunt, Patrick H.] Basketball Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Australian Institute of Sport; Auckland University of Technology; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Montgomery, PG (corresponding author), Australian Inst Sport, Dept Physiol, POB 176, Belconnen, ACT 2616, Australia.",paulm@saints.com.au,,"Pyne, David/0000-0003-1555-5079; Minahan, Clare/0000-0002-4777-4033",,,,,34,46,53,0,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-1391,1536-7290,,EUR J SPORT SCI,Eur.

Our experiment focuses on two stochastic audit schemes for enforcing regulatory compliance. In the Random Audit mechanism firms are randomly chosen for inspection. In the Tournament Audit mechanism the probability of inspection increases with the degree of estimated under-reporting. To study the effects of social information, the experiment varies the observability of identity, output, and compliance decisions. Optimal output is theoretically independent of the auditing scheme, but equilibrium reporting is higher under the Tournament mechanism than Random auditing. Experimental findings are broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions for reporting, but deviate modestly for output. In particular, we find that average output is lower and reporting is higher in the Tournament treatment compared to the Random Audit treatment. At the individual level, a majority of participants misreported in most periods. Social observability does not affect output or reporting significantly in either of the audit treatments.

In each one of multiple rounds, subjects are shown two cue values, Cue A and Cue B, and asked to predict the value of a third variable X, which is a noisy function of the two cue values. The subjects' aim is to predict the value of X as accurately as possible. Our metric of performance is the absolute error, i.e., the absolute distance between the actual and predicted values of X. We implement four treatments which are based on two different payment schemes: (1) piece rates, where subjects are paid linearly on the basis of their own absolute errors and (2) a two-person winner-take-all-tournament, where subjects are paired and the one with a smaller absolute error earns a fixed payoff, while the other earns nothing. We find that it is only in the tournament payment scheme, and particularly in a more complex version of the task, that subjects show significant evidence of learning over time, in that their predictions get closer to the actual value of X. This learning process is driven by the all-or-nothing nature of the payoff structure in tournaments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although wartime atrocities all-too-often ignite destructive cycles of tit-for-tat war crimes, powerful third parties can de-escalate the bloodshed. Therefore, following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, we aimed to reduce Americans' support for committing retributive war crimes against Russian soldiers. To intervene during the earliest stages of the invasion, we drew on theories of dehumanization and parasocial intergroup contact to curate publicly available media expected to humanize Russian soldiers. We then identified the most effective materials by simultaneously evaluating all of them with an intervention tournament. This allowed us to quickly implement a psychological intervention that reliably reduced support for war crimes during the first days of a momentous land war.

Materials and Methods: A total of 7832 patients were randomized to diet alone or diet plus low-dose pravastatin (10-20 mg/day, average 8.3 mg during follow-up periods) and followed for >5 years. In this analysis, the relationship between FPG and risk of cardiovascular disease events over 5 years were studied in 6673 patients with recorded baseline FPG levels by using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with the restricted quadratic spline based on three knots for FPG quartiles. Results: The spline curve showed an obvious sharp increased risk from a FPG of >= 100 mg/dL. The spline curve in the diet plus pravastatin group was consistently lower than in the diet group, regardless of the FPG level. Conclusions: The risk of cardiovascular disease appears to increase when FPG is >= 100 mg/dL, with a sharp increased risk found above this level in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Statin treatment seems to be beneficial to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT00211705).

The paper shows how competitive versus team incentives compare in motivating Ugandan farmers to learn and share information relevant to adopting a new agricultural technology. We find that tournament-based incentives provide greater outcomes in terms of total information learned than threshold-based team incentives. Furthermore the order of the incentive - whether the tournament precedes or follows the team incentive scheme - does not affect the volume of information learned. New information introduced between rounds was learned by more individuals under team incentives than under tournament incentives. The study provides direct practical policy recommendations for improving learning in the context of agriculture in Uganda. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Pravastatin reduces the incidence of CH D (hazard ratio = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.49-0.91). In the MEGA study, in addition to the usual loss to follow-up cases, there is another problem of drop-outs due to the refusal of further follow-up at 5 years. Purpose To estimate the treatment effect adjusting for some types of dependent censorings observed in the MEGA study and to assess the sensitivity of standard analysis results for these censoring cases. Methods The proposed method is a straightforward extension of the inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) method for settings with more than one reason for censoring, where the propensities for drop-outs are modeled separately for each reason. Simulation studies are also conducted to compare the properties of the IPCW estimate with the standard analysis assuming independent censorings. Results Simulation studies show that the IPCW estimate can correct for selection bias due to dependent censoring that can be explained by measured factors, while the standard analysis is biased. Applying the proposed method to the MEGA study data, several prognostic factors are associated with the censoring processes, and after adjusting for these dependent censorings, slightly larger treatment effects for pravastatin are observed for both CHD (primary endpoint) and stroke (secondary endpoint) events. Limitations The method developed is based on the fundamental assumption of sequentially ignorable censoring. Conclusions Our proposed method provides a valuable approach for estimating treatment effect adjusting for several types of dependent censorings. Dependent censorings observed in the MEGA study did not cause a severe selection bias attributable to the covariates and the results from the standard analysis were robust in relation to the censorings.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Prevent Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth Sci & Nursing, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; EPS Co Ltd, Clin Serv Provider, Bunkyo Ku, Div Biometr, Tokyo 1120004, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Matsuyama, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Sch Hlth Sci & Nursing, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",matuyama@epistat.m.u-tokyo.ac.ip,,,,,,,16,22,23,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1740-7745,,,CLIN TRIALS,Clin.

Participants also completed a questionnaire on their experiences of forecasting. Results: There were 17 participants in the first tournament and nine in the second tournament, with no new participants. In both tournaments, the majority of participants scored a Brier Skill Score above the benchmark of 0. The median Brier Skill Score improved slightly between the two tournaments. Participants reported luck and changing political climates as impacting their performance. Participants reported forecasting in their day job but had received no formal training to do so.Conclusions: Forecasting is an important public health skill, and human judgement forecasting tournaments can be run amongst public health practitioners with little time and resource requirements. Further research would help identify whether training, teamwork or other interventions can improve public health forecasting accuracy.","[Davies, Nathan] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham City Hosp, Sch Med, Clin Sci Bldg,Hucknall Rd, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Ferris, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Nottingham, England",Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; Nottingham City Hospital; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Davies, N (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham City Hosp, Sch Med, Clin Sci Bldg,Hucknall Rd, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England.",nathan.davies@nottingham.ac.uk,"; Davies, Nathan/W-6693-2019","Davies, Nathan/0000-0002-9112-6471; Davies, Nathan/0000-0003-1625-9204",,,,,6,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-5352,,,PUBLIC HEALTH PRACT,Public Health Pract.,JUN,2022,3,,,,,,,,100260,10.1016/j.puhip.2022.100260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2022.100260,,,3,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",DV1N4,35479262,"Green Published, gold",,,7/25/25,WOS:001134766800039,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed this relation using clinical data on Japanese individuals with hypercholesterolemia. Methods: In the large-scale MEGA Study 7832 patients aged 40 to 70 years old with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia without CVD were randomized to diet alone or diet plus pravastatin and followed for >5 years. In the present subanalysis of that study a total of 4002 patients with baseline and follow-up HbA1c data were stratified according to having an average HbA1c during the first year of follow-up <6.0%, 6.0%-<6.5%, or >= 6.5% and their subsequent 5-year incidence rates of CVD compared according to sex, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and treatment arm. Results: Overall, risk of CVD was significantly 2.4 times higher in individuals with HbA1c >= 6.5% versus <6.0%. A similar relation was noted in men and women (hazard ratio [HR], 2.1; p <0.01 and HR, 3.0; p <0.01, respectively) and was regardless of treatment arm (diet alone group: HR, 2.2; p <0.001; diet plus pravastatin group: HR, 1.8; p = 0.02). Spline curves showed a continuous risk increase according to HbA1c level in all subpopulations studied. Conclusions: In hypercholesterolemic individuals the risk of CVD increases linearly with HbA1c level. This significant contribution by elevated HbA1c to increased CVD is independent of pravastatin therapy, and thus requires appropriate HbA1c management in addition to lipids reduction.","[Nishimura, Rimei] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Div Diabet Metab & Endocrinol, Dept Internal Med,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Nakagami, Tomoko] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Ctr Diabet, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628666, Japan; [Sone, Hirohito] Univ Tsukuba, Inst Clin Med, Dept Internal Med, Mito, Ibaraki 3100015, Japan; [Ohashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Prevent Hlth Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Jikei University; Tokyo Women's Medical University; University of Tsukuba; University of Tokyo,"Nishimura, R (corresponding author), Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Div Diabet Metab & Endocrinol, Dept Internal Med,Minato Ku, 3-25-8 Nishi Shinbashi, Tokyo 1058461, Japan.",rimei@yahoo.co.jp,"Sone, Hirohito/ABC-9346-2021; Tajima, Naoko/AAR-7470-2020","Sone, Hirohito/0000-0003-1263-2817;","Daiichi-Sankyo Co, Ltd.; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20300227] Funding Source: KAKEN","Daiichi-Sankyo Co, Ltd.(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors sincerely thank the MEGA Study Group for providing their data.

Previous work has shown that this paradigm can successfully capture subtle priming effects (Heyman, De Deyne, Hutchison, & Storms Behavior Research Methods, 47, 580-606, 2015). In addition, it has several advantages over the widely used lexical decision task. That is, the speeded word fragment completion task is more efficient, more engaging, and easier. Given its potential, we conducted a study to gather speeded word fragment completion norms. The goal of this megastudy was twofold. On the one hand, it provides a rich database of over 8,000 stimuli, which can, for instance, be used in future research to equate stimuli on baseline response times. On the other hand, the aim was to gain insight into the underlying processes of the speeded word fragment completion task. To this end, item-level regression and mixed-effects analyses were performed on the response latencies using 23 predictor variables. Since all items were selected from the Dutch Lexicon Project (Keuleers, Diependaele, & Brysbaert Frontiers in Psychology, 1, 174, 2010), we ran the same analyses on lexical decision latencies to compare the two tasks. Overall, the results revealed many similarities, but also some remarkable differences, which are discussed. We propose that both tasks are complementary when examining visual word recognition.

In deeper water bodies, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu are often caught from depths greater than 6 m and held in a boat's live well until they are weighed in. Smallmouth Bass that are caught from such depths typically display symptoms of barotrauma, where the swim bladder becomes overinflated and the fish cannot maintain proper orientation. We examined the effects of three common practices that are used by tournament anglers who hold fish that exhibit symptoms of barotrauma: no treatment, weighted fin clips (rubber-coated weighted alligator clips), and fizzing (venting the swim bladder with a hypodermic needle). After receiving a treatment, the Smallmouth Bass were held in experimental live wells for a period of 3 h and their condition was monitored using reflex action mortality predictors. Condition declined for the Smallmouth Bass that received no treatment, whereas both fin clips and fizzing demonstrated improved fish condition. Fizzing was also found to be a more rapid and effective treatment than fin clips. As the weight and capture depth of fish in the control group increased, there was a significant decrease in final condition, as indicated by reflex impairment. For tournaments that hold fish in live wells prior to release, these results demonstrate that interventions shortly after capture can effectively reduce reflex impairment in Smallmouth Bass that experience barotrauma and that fizzing is more effective than fin clips.","[Elliott, Connor W.; Row, Alexander J.; Tufts, Bruce L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Freshwater Fisheries Conservat Lab, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Elliott, CW (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Freshwater Fisheries Conservat Lab, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",connor.elliott@queensu.ca,"Elliott, Connor/AEN-6914-2022",,Greenberg Family Fund for the Conservation of Freshwater Fisheries at Queen's University,Greenberg Family Fund for the Conservation of Freshwater Fisheries at Queen's University,"Financial support for this study was provided by the Greenberg Family Fund for the Conservation of Freshwater Fisheries at Queen's University.

As SNMs for a failure time outcome, structural nested accelerated failure time models (SNAFTMs) and structural nested cumulative failure time models have been developed. The latter models are included in the class of structural nested mean models (SNMMs) and are not involved in artificial censoring, which induces several difficulties in g-estimation of SNAFTMs. Recently, restricted mean time lost (RMTL), which corresponds to the area under a distribution function up to a restriction time, is attracting attention in clinical trial communities as an appropriate summary measure of a failure time outcome. In this study, we propose another SNMM for a failure time outcome, which is called structural nested RMTL model (SNRMTLM) and describe randomized and observational g-estimation procedures that use different assumptions for the treatment mechanism in a randomized trial setting. We also provide methods to estimate marginal RMTLs under static treatment regimes using estimated SNRMTLMs. A simulation study evaluates finite-sample performances of the proposed methods compared with the conventional intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We illustrate the proposed methods using data from a randomized controlled trial for cardiovascular disease with treatment changes. G-estimation of SNRMTLMs is a useful tool to estimate the effects of time-varying treatments on a failure time outcome.","[Hagiwara, Yasuhiro; Matsuyama, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Tokyo, Japan; [Shinozaki, Tomohiro] Tokyo Univ Sci, Fac Engn, Dept Informat & Comp Technol, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; Tokyo University of Science,"Hagiwara, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 113001, Japan.",hagiwara@epistat.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Shinozaki, Tomohiro/0000-0003-3395-9691","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H29-ICT-General-004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K11716] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. for allowing us to use the valuable MEGA study data.

We study the effects of tournaments on team performance in a nonroutine task and identify the importance of these behavioral aspects. In a field experiment (n > 1,700 participants), we vary the salience of team identity, social image concerns, and whether teams face monetary incentives. Increased salience of team identity does not improve performance. Social image motivates the top performers.

To avert hundreds of thousands of unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths, adoption will need to be higher than it was in the autumn of 2022 or 2023, when less than one-fifth of Americans received booster vaccines1,2. One approach to encouraging vaccination is to eliminate the friction of transportation hurdles. Previous research has shown that friction can hinder follow-through3 and that individuals who live farther from COVID-19 vaccination sites are less likely to get vaccinated4. However, the value of providing free round-trip transportation to vaccination sites is unknown. Here we show that offering people free round-trip Lyft rides to pharmacies has no benefit over and above sending them behaviourally informed text messages reminding them to get vaccinated. We determined this by running a megastudy with millions of CVS Pharmacy patients in the United States testing the effects of (1) free round-trip Lyft rides to CVS Pharmacies for vaccination appointments and (2) seven different sets of behaviourally informed vaccine reminder messages. Our results suggest that offering previously vaccinated individuals free rides to vaccination sites is not a good investment in the United States, contrary to the high expectations of both expert and lay forecasters. Instead, people in the United States should be sent behaviourally informed COVID-19 vaccination reminders, which increased the 30-day COVID-19 booster uptake by 21% (1.05 percentage points) and spilled over to increase 30-day influenza vaccinations by 8% (0.34 percentage points) in our megastudy. More rigorous testing of interventions to promote vaccination is needed to ensure that evidence-based solutions are deployed widely and that ineffective but intuitively appealing tools are discontinued. Contrary to expectations, offers of free transportation to vaccine sites did not increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake more than text message reminders, a finding that has implications for future policy decision-making to promote vaccination.","[Milkman, Katherine L.; Kuan, Robert; Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ellis, Sean F.; Gromet, Dena M.; Jung, Youngwoo; Luscher, Alex S.; Paxson, Madeline K.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Behav Change Good Initiat, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ellis, Sean F.; Gromet, Dena M.; Jung, Youngwoo; Luscher, Alex S.; Paxson, Madeline K.; Zumaran, Ramon A.

In this randomized controlled trial design, four youth teams from Iran's national premier league participated in a simulated futsal tournament (five days, three matches). Sixteen youth futsal players from two teams (age: 19.1 +/- 1.3 years old) were randomly distributed into two groups: (i) passive recovery (PR); and (ii) FR recovery. The FR recovery protocol consisted of five repetitions of 40 s separated by 20 s of rest on calf, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles 5 min after each match. The other group rested passively during the same period. The Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 2, repeated sprint ability, vertical jump, and PRO agility tests were assessed pre- and post-tournament. Also, Hooper index (HI) and blood lactate concentrations were measured throughout matchdays. Data were analyzed by a repeated measure ANOVA and ANCOVA. Substantial improvements in HI on the second (ES:0.6) and third (ES:0.4) matchdays and faster lactate removal on the third (ES:0.3) matchday were observed in the FR group when compared to the PR group (p < 0.05). Although FR recovery was slightly beneficial when compared to PR attenuated decrements in aerobic (-1.6%vs-9.7%) and anaerobic performance (-4.5%vs-1.3%), vertical jump (-1.6%vs-3.0%), and change of direction (-2.1%vs-4.3%), these effects were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The finding showed using FR during compact competitions expedites physical performance recovery, increases blood lactate clearance and leads to regenerate psychological characteristics. Therefore, along with other desirable recovery strategies, the use of FR could be recommended in short-term compacted futsal tournaments.","[Rahimi, Ali; Amani-Shalamzari, Sadegh] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Phys Educ & Sports Sci, Dept Exercise Physiol, Tehran, Iran; [Clemente, Filipe Manuel] Inst Politecn Viana Castelo, Escola Super Desporto & Lazer, Rua Escola Ind & Comercial NunAlvares, P-4900347 Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Clemente, Filipe Manuel] Inst Telecomunicacoes, Delegacao Covilha, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Kharazmi University; Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Instituto de Telecomunicacoes,"Clemente, FM (corresponding author), Complexo Desport & Lazer Melgaco Monte Prado, P-4960320 Melgaco, Portugal.",filipeclemente@esdl.ipvc.pt,"Clemente, Filipe/G-2625-2012; Amani-Shalamzari, Sadegh/AAR-6446-2020; Amani shalamzari, Sadegh/AAR-6446-2020; Clemente, Filipe Manuel/G-2625-2012","Amani-Shalamzari, Sadegh/0000-0002-3021-8970; Clemente, Filipe Manuel/0000-0001-9813-2842",,,,,50,11,11,0,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0031-9384,1873-507X,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

Nine competitive male tennis players (age, 24.6 +/- 4.2 years) with national ranking positions (German Tennis Federation) and Universal Tennis Ratings between approximately 11-13 participated in two singles tennis tournaments, which were separated by a three-month washout period. During the tournaments, participants played five two-and-a-half-hour competitive singles tennis match on five consecutive days. For the assignment to one of two groups, athletes were matched into homogeneous pairs according to their ranking. Then, within each pair, the players were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group performed MMR during the first tournament, whereas the other group used passive recovery (PAS). During the second tournament, recovery conditions were interchanged. Measures of physical and technical performance as well as physiological and perceptual responses (heart rate, blood lactate concentration, perceived exertion) were recorded during match-play sessions. Furthermore, muscle soreness, perceived recovery state, blood markers, countermovement jump height (CMJ), and repeated sprint ability (RSA) were determined before, during, and after the five-day tournament periods. Results showed significant changes over time (P < 0.05) in muscle soreness, perceived recovery state, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor 1, and countermovement jump height. However, no significant differences or recovery strategy x time interactions were noted either for tennis-specific performance (e.g. number of total points won) or any other of the measured parameters between MMR and PAS (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the repeated use of MMR during and after a five-day tennis tournament did not affect match performance, match load, or recovery from repeated days of tennis match play.","[Wiewelhove, Thimo] IST Univ Appl Sci, Erkrather Str 220 a-c, D-40233 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Szwajca, Sebastian; Busch, Maximilian; Doeweling, Alexander; Volk, Nicola Reiner; Schneider, Christoph; Kellmann, Michael; Ferrauti, Alexander] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Sport Sci, Bochum, Germany; [Meyer, Tim] Saarland Univ, Inst Sports & Prevent Med, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Kellmann, Michael] Univ Queensland, Sch Human Movement & Nutr Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Pfeiffer, Mark] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Sports Sci, Mainz, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; Saarland University; University of Queensland; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Wiewelhove, T (corresponding author), IST Univ Appl Sci, Erkrather Str 220 a-c, D-40233 Dusseldorf, Germany.",twiewelhove@ist-hochschule.de,"; Schneider, Christoph/E-6624-2019; Wiewelhove, Sport/Q-3672-2019; Ferrauti, Alexander/P-9577-2019; Kellmann, Michael/J-3508-2014","Volk, Nicola Reiner/0000-0003-4594-2619; Schneider, Christoph/0000-0003-3760-7001; Kellmann, Michael/0000-0003-1699-9624; Alexander, Ferrauti/0000-0001-9807-2755; Pfeiffer, Mark/0000-0002-9287-5343",German Federal Institute of Sport Science; International Tennis Federation,German Federal Institute of Sport Science; International Tennis Federation,"Finally, the authors also wish to acknowledge that the funding for this study was contributed by the German Federal Institute of Sport Science and the International Tennis Federation.",,47,4,4,2,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-1391,1536-7290,,EUR J SPORT SCI,Eur.

In response, practitioners have created media interventions that aim to reduce Islamophobia. However, it is unclear what causal effects these interventions have on reducing Islamophobia. Here, we test the effects of 11 media interventions developed by practitioners with an intervention tournament among U.S. samples. In Study 1, we identified three videos that most effectively reduced Islamophobia both immediately after watching and 1 month later. In Studies 2-4, we examined the psychological mechanisms of these successful videos and found an indirect effect of the interventions on reduced support for anti-Muslim policies through recognition of media bias against Muslims. This research highlights that drawing attention to structural biases, including biased media coverage of Muslims, is one potential strategy for ameliorating Islamophobia.","[Moore-Berg, Samantha L.; Falk, Emily; Bruneau, Emile] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Moore-Berg, Samantha L.; Bruneau, Emile] Beyond Conflict, Boston, MA USA; [Hameiri, Boaz] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",University of Pennsylvania; Tel Aviv University,"Moore-Berg, SL (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Samantha.mooreberg@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,65,6,6,3,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4302,1461-7188,,GROUP PROCESS INTERG,Group Process Intergroup Relat.,APR,2023,26,3,,,,,555,578,1.37E+16,10.1177/13684302221085832,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13684302221085832,,Apr-22,24,"Psychology, Social",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,D4QZ2,,,,,7/25/25,WOS:000783587700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tournaments often include Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu and occur throughout fishing seasons; however, there have yet to be any systematic congeneric comparisons across different seasons. Objectives of our study were to (1) assess post-tournament dispersal of Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass (i.e., short-term stockpiling-accumulation of fish around weigh-in site <1 month after tournament) across seasons, and (2) determine the success of return to the main basin. Research took place on Big Rideau Lake in eastern Ontario and included a preseason control (N = 30) where fish were captured, acoustically tagged, and released at the site of tournament weigh-in (Rideau Ferry). Tournament-caught bass (N = 88 total) were tagged at three tournaments that spanned June (early season), August (midseason), and October (late season). Our results indicated a brief short-term stockpiling (within 300 m) in all seasons, and all detected fish eventually returned to the main basin. Tournament-caught Largemouth Bass tended to take longer to disperse from the release site following the midseason tournament (4.6 d); Smallmouth Bass tended to disperse from release site <1 d following all treatments. Similarly, tournament-caught Largemouth Bass exposed to the midseason tournament tended to take the longest to redistribute to the main basin (238 d) in comparison to other treatments. Although Smallmouth Bass tended to redistribute to the main basin faster than Largemouth Bass, late-season Smallmouth Bass tended to redistribute the slowest (101 d) following tournament release. Although fish do survive and eventually return to the main basin, displacement may have broader ecological consequences (i.e., large-scale displacement of top predators, adverse effects on recruitment) such that there would be merit in more catch-weigh-release formatted events.","[Abrams, Alice E., I; Zolderdo, A.

However, one aspect of tournaments that has received little attention is barotrauma. At a fall competitive angling event on Rainy Lake in northwestern Ontario, we evaluated the incidence of barotrauma among tournament-caught smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu; we then tagged and released a subset of fish that had severe barotrauma indicators and compared physiology, postrelease behavior, and fate between these fish and those with negligible signs of barotrauma. Overall, 76% of fish had at least one sign of barotraurna (either hemorrhaging or swim bladder distention), but only 32% of fish had two or more indicators and were thus deemed to have severe barotrauma. When telemetered fish were released at a common site, we determined that fish with negligible signs of barotrauma evacuated the release site more rapidly than fish with severe barotrauma did. Some fish with barotraurna floundered at the surface when released, and one of these fish was subsequently hit and killed by a boat. At the end of the monitoring period, 20% of fish with severe barotrauma had died; two additional individuals (20%) that were still at the release site were moribund (failed to respond to diver stimuli). Conversely, we failed to observe any mortality in fish with negligible signs of barotrauma. All tournament fish had elevated levels of blood glucose and lactate. However, stress indices were higher in fish with barotrauma and tended to be highest among fish with barotrauma that died after release. This study revealed that the incidence of barotrauma in tournaments can be high; moreover, outside of a laboratory environment, a significant proportion of fish with severe barotrauma may die after release. Additional research is needed to determine the seasonal variation in incidence and consequences of barotrauma as well as the effectiveness of different depressurization techniques in the field that could be used during fishing tournaments.","[Gravel, Marie-Ange; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Cooke, SJ (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",steven_cooke@carleton.ca,"; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659;",,,,,52,55,64,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-5947,1548-8675,,N AM J FISH MANAGE,North Am.

Catch-and-release angling and its effects on nest abandonment have been well documented, but few studies have examined the effects of competitive angling on nest abandonment. Nest-guarding male largemouth bass were subjected to one of three treatments: no angling (controls), catch-and-release angling, and simulated tournament angling. Abandonment rates were assessed at 24 h following angling. Both angling treatments experienced higher abandonment rates than the control group (3%) with tournament-angled males abandoning their nests at a higher rate (90%) than catch-and-release males (33%). Additional research will be required to determine the population-level consequences of these angling practices. Until then, a conservative recommendation would be for organizers to consider alternative tournament formats during the reproductive season for largemouth bass.","[Diana, Matthew J.; Larsen, Aaron L.; Siepker, Michael J.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA",University of Illinois System; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Diana, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1235 Cty Rd 1000N, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA.",mattd@illinois.edu,"Siepker, Michael/O-6042-2019",,,,,,37,8,10,0,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"520 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0275-5947,1548-8675,,N AM J FISH MANAGE,North Am.

For this, largemouth bass were first exercised and recovered for either 1, 2 or 4 h at ambient water temperatures (25 degrees C) in fully oxygenated water. Results showed that exercise forced fish to utilize anaerobic metabolism to meet energy demands, and resulted in reductions in anaerobic energy stores adenosine triphosphate (ATP), Phosphocreatine (PCr) and glycogen. Exercise also resulted in a seven-fold increase in lactate within white muscle. After 2 h of recovery in oxygenated water at acclimation temperature, physiological recovery from exercise was under way, and by 4 h most variables examined had returned to control levels. Next, largemouth bass were exercised at ambient temperatures and recovered for 2 h in environments with either elevated temperature (32 degrees C), reduced temperature (14 and 20 degrees C), hypoxia or hyperoxia. Both elevated and reduced temperature impaired recovery of tissue lactate and tissue ATP relative to fish recovered in water at acclimation temperature, while hyperoxic water impaired recovery of tissue ATP. Moderately hypoxic waters impaired the recovery of plasma glucose, plasma lactate and tissue PCr relative to fish recovered in fully oxygenated water. Results from this study are discussed in the context of critical oxygen and temperature guidelines for largemouth bass. In addition, several recommendations are made concerning remedial treatments used in livewells (tanks) during angling tournaments when fish are recovering from exercise associated with angling.

To reduce mortality, authors suggested changes in aerator operation and weigh-in procedures. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation began an evaluation of recommended fish care practices under actual tournament conditions. Seasonal differences in mortality were compared during five 1995 tournaments where weigh-in practices were standardized to minimize bias associated with organizational variation. Total mortality was significantly higher in summer than in spring (34% and 3%, respectively; P = 0.02). In Summer 1996, mortality was estimated during five tournaments that used the same weigh-in practices but anglers were assigned to treatment groups that used different livewell aeration procedures. Total mortality of fish held with intermittent aeration was 32 percent. Continuous freshwater flow-through/ aeration resulted in 25 percent mortality. By adding ice to cool livewell water, noniodized salt to help fish maintain osmotic balance, and using continuous recirculation/ aeration, mortality was reduced to 17 percent. In six Summer 1998 trials, using freshwater flow-through and recirculation/ aeration concurrently, mortality averaged 15 percent. Diffusing pure oxygen into livewell water resulted in the lowest total mortality among all treatments, reducing summer mortality to levels similar to those seen during spring trials (7%; P = 0.05). To reduce mortality of black bass released following summer tournaments, it is recommended that anglers: pump fresh water as frequently as possible and maximize oxygen levels with continuous recirculation/ aeration; or use continuous recirculation /aeration, periodic water exchange and temperature control; or diffuse pure oxygen into livewell water.","Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, Norman, OK 73072 USA",,"Gilliland, ER (corresponding author), Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, 500 E Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA.",,,,,,,,39,20,24,0,5,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, STE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0892-2284,,1-888569-38-7,AM FISH S S,,,2002,31,,,,,,477,487,,,,,,11,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BW08F,,,,,7/25/25,WOS:000180817600039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Anglers often mark individual fish to easily identify them based on weight and to reduce handling time. However, there is limited information about the physiological consequences of using different culling apparatus on fish. This study examined the physiological consequences associated with using four different types of culling apparatus (i.e., metal stringer through the jaw, pincher on the jaw, lasso around the caudal peduncle, and zippered mesh bag) on Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides relative to controls during a 2-h live-well retention period. Blood samples were taken afterwards and were analyzed for blood glucose, blood lactate, plasma cortisol, and osmolality. Compared to the baseline control (i.e., fish that were captured, subjected to blood sampling, and immediately released), blood parameters (except osmolality) were significantly elevated in all treatments. The pincher and lasso treatments tended to yield higher physiological disturbances than the other treatments, including fish that were held in the live well without any culling apparatus. Moreover, the lasso culling apparatus appeared to cause noticeable injury relative to the other culling devices. Our research provides valuable information to help guide the selection of culling gear that maintains the welfare status of retained fish during tournaments.","[Chong, Daniel R.; Abrams, Alice E.

Anglers often mark individual fish to easily identify them based on weight and to reduce handling time. However, there is limited information about the physiological consequences of using different culling apparatus on fish. This study examined the physiological consequences associated with using four different types of culling apparatus (i.e., metal stringer through the jaw, pincher on the jaw, lasso around the caudal peduncle, and zippered mesh bag) on Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides relative to controls during a 2-h live-well retention period. Blood samples were taken afterwards and were analyzed for blood glucose, blood lactate, plasma cortisol, and osmolality. Compared to the baseline control (i.e., fish that were captured, subjected to blood sampling, and immediately released), blood parameters (except osmolality) were significantly elevated in all treatments. The pincher and lasso treatments tended to yield higher physiological disturbances than the other treatments, including fish that were held in the live well without any culling apparatus. Moreover, the lasso culling apparatus appeared to cause noticeable injury relative to the other culling devices. Our research provides valuable information to help guide the selection of culling gear that maintains the welfare status of retained fish during tournaments.","[Chong, Daniel R.; Abrams, Alice E.

Our group tested and found support for three psychological drivers of accuracy: training, teaming, and tracking. Probability training corrected cognitive biases, encouraged forecasters to use reference classes, and provided forecasters with heuristics, such as averaging when multiple estimates were available. Teaming allowed forecasters to share information and discuss the rationales behind their beliefs. Tracking placed the highest performers (top 2% from Year 1) in elite teams that worked together. Results showed that probability training, team collaboration, and tracking improved both calibration and resolution. Forecasting is often viewed as a statistical problem, but forecasts can be improved with behavioral interventions. Training, teaming, and tracking are psychological interventions that dramatically increased the accuracy of forecasts. Statistical algorithms (reported elsewhere) improved the accuracy of the aggregation. Putting both statistics and psychology to work produced the best forecasts 2 years in a row.","[Mellers, Barbara; Baron, Jonathan; Gurcay, Burcu; Fincher, Katrina; Scott, Sydney E.; Atanasov, Pavel; Stone, Eric; Tetlock, Philip E.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ungar, Lyle] Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ramos, Jaime] Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Moore, Don; Swift, Samuel A.; Murray, Terry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Rice University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mellers, B (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 3815 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mellers@wharton.upenn.edu,"Baron, Jonathan9/AAI-1488-2019; Moore, Don/V-2793-2019; Scott, Sydney/IWU-9960-2023; Bastos, Rafael/ABC-3042-2022; Stone, Eric/IQX-1707-2023","Scott, Sydney/0000-0002-8992-5936",,,,,40,183,213,0,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Goalkeepers are more likely to injure their upper limbs, particularly their shoulders, than outfield players. To reduce upper extremity injuries, the FIFA 11+ Shoulder Injury Prevention Program (FIFA 11+S) was developed. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the FIFA 11+S program in reducing the incidence of upper extremity injuries among amateur soccer goalkeepers. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 726 goalkeepers, who were blinded to study intent, were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 360) or control group (n = 366). The experimental group was instructed to perform the FIFA 11+S program before all training sessions for 1 season (6 months). The control group was instructed to continue performing their usual routine warm-up program before training sessions for 1 season. Primary outcomes included the incidence of upper extremity injury and incidence of mechanism, type, and severity of injury measured using injury risk ratios (IRR); compliance with the experimental and control interventions was also recorded. Results: A total of 50 injuries (0.62 injuries per 1000 exposure-hours) were reported in the experimental group, and 122 injuries (1.94 injuries/1000 hours) were reported in the control group. The FIFA 11+S program reduced the total number of upper extremity injuries by 68% (IRR = 0.32 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]) compared with the usual warm-up. The FIFA 11+S program reduced the incidence of contact injury (IRR = 0.30 [95% CI, 0.25-0.31]), noncontact injury (IRR = 0.40 [95% CI, 0.35-0.43]), initial injury (IRR = 0.34 [95% CI, 0.29-0.36]), recurrent injury (IRR = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.17-0.21]), and overuse injury (IRR = 0.40 [95% CI, 0.35-0.43]). Participants in the experimental group demonstrated a significant decrease in injuries of minor (IRR = 0.32 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]) and moderate severity (IRR = 0.33 [95% CI, 0.29-0.35]) compared with the control group. We noted no difference in compliance between the experimental and control groups (80% vs 73%, respectively; P = .92). Conclusion: The FIFA 11+S program resulted in 50% fewer upper extremity injuries among soccer goalkeepers, compared with a regular warm-up.

Results: Between I May 1997 and 15 August 1998 a total of 109,139 calls were recorded. During the period of the World Cup (10 June-12 July 1998) there was an overall decrease in rescue requests, distress calls, treatments in a mobile intensive care unit, and ambulance runs. There was no significant decrease during, the French team matches except that between France and Italy. Discussion: Rescue requests vary with the occurrence of public events. The decline which we discovered affected not the period of specific matches but the duration of the entire tournament.

Yet, many studies also document substantial negative effects of RPF, in particular for low-achievers. We study a novel type of RPF designed to overcome these negative effects of RPF on low-achievers by scoring individual performance improvements . With a sample of 400 children, we conduct a class-wise randomized-controlled trial using an e-learning software in regular teaching lessons in primary schools. We demonstrate that this type of RPF significantly increases motivation, effort, and performance in math for low-achieving children, without hurting high-achieving children. Among low-achievers, those receiving more points and moving up in the ranking improved strongest on motivation and math performance. In an exploratory analysis, we document substantial gender differences in response to this type of RPF: improvements in motivation and learning are much stronger for girls. We argue that using this new type of RPF could potentially reduce inequalities, especially in educational settings. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime (R), NBS Presentation (R), Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer configuration.","[Bridges, David; Peirce, Jonathan W.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham, England; [Pitiot, Alain] Ilixa Ltd, Lab Image & Data Anal, London, England; [MacAskill, Michael R.] Univ Otago, Dept Med, Christchurch, New Zealand; [MacAskill, Michael R.] New Zealand Brain Res Inst, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Nottingham; University of Otago,"Peirce, JW (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham, England.",jonathan.peirce@nottingham.ac.uk,"Peirce, Jonathan/AAA-8603-2020; MacAskill, Michael/C-3467-2009","MacAskill, Michael/0000-0001-9073-0346",Wellcome Trust [208368],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust (No. 208368).

We employed a randomized, controlled trial methodology. The students needed to use similar data structures and algorithms, presented during lectures, for both projects. The first half of the milestones were almost identical for both groups, but the open-ended project asked students to develop a player strategy for a specific board game, while in the other project the students executed the game by communicating with the player modules and verifying the moves against the rules of the game. In the final stages of the project while one group of students worked on honing their own strategy, the other students implemented a pre-specified tie breaking mechanism used when two player strategies tie in a match. At the end of the term, both groups had a friendly tournament: the player strategies faced each other for the ultimate winner while the other group's submissions were ranked by a team of judges based on the implementation's correctness and style. The tournament was just for fun - it did not contribute to the final grade.

Video analyses revealed that largemouth bass were active during low intensity disturbances, but during violent boat movements tended to settle to the bottom of the livewell and orient to face the direction of the disturbance. Walleye were less active than bass for all treatments, and additionally did not orient to face the direction of disturbance, consequently contacting the side of the livewell during boat rocking.

Thus, it is important to identify novel interventions that reduce dehumanization and explore the mechanism(s)-both established (e.g., empathy induction, intergroup contact) and relatively understudied (e.g., humor)-driving the effects. To address this issue, in Study 1 (N = 2,349), we conducted an intervention tournament and found that a video (i.e., Mean Tweets) of a relatable and diverse group of young Muslims ridiculing Islamophobic comments posted on an online video of a Muslim preschool burning down effectively reduces hostility towards Muslims. Specifically, the Mean Tweets intervention significantly reduced dehumanization of Muslims and, although the effects were weaker, anti-Muslim policy support. However, a follow-up study conducted 1 month later revealed that these effects subsided. Next, in a preregistered study (i.e., Study 2) (N = 677), we find that our intervention reliably reduced dehumanization of Muslims, but the reduction of anti-Muslim policy support was not replicated. While investigating our intervention's effect on anti-Muslim policy support, we find that our intervention led participants to discount the intervention's intended message, which could have short-circuited the intervention's effectiveness on policy support. Considering these results, we discuss the potential psychological processes (e.g., humor, message discounting, tone) underlying our dehumanization-reducing intervention.","[Gallardo, Roman A.

Design and Setting: Collected data from the Minnesota State Wrestling 3-class tournament over a 10-year period from 1997 through 2006. Patients: Male wrestlers 13 to 18 years of age who have qualified by placing first or second in their section tournaments. Interventions: On-site physicians screen athletes that have suspicious lesions and review those who have already been seen by their local healthcare providers. Athletes are allowed to compete if their lesions are considered noninfectious. Main Outcome Measurements: After review of the data, a distinct difference was noted with the number of skin infections seen in the larger schools compared to the smaller ones. Review of the Minnesota Medical Association's data base for available healthcare providers was correlated with the communities these infected wrestlers were from. Results: Each of the 3 classes had 23 8 participants each year. A total of 299 skin infections were recorded over this 10-year period. Analysis of class comparison and number of skin infections reveals a significant difference, with class A (smaller schools) having 81 infections compared to class AAA (larger schools) having 119, P = 0.0076. Comparison of healthcare providers finds a distinct difference with the smaller communities having 1.5 providers per town compared with larger schools having 66.4 providers per town. Conclusion: Continuity, not availability, of healthcare is necessary to properly control skin infections in high school wrestling.","Augsburg Coll, Minneapolis, MN USA",Augsburg University,"Anderson, BJ (corresponding author), 2724 Isle Royale Court, Burnsville, MN 55337 USA.",amosnandie@msn.com,,,,,,,6,7,7,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1050-642X,1536-3724,,CLIN J SPORT MED,Clin.

Hypothesis/Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and nature of time-loss injuries and illness during the pre-season and competition period of the 2017 Super Rugby tournament in a single South African team. Study Design Descriptive Epidemiology Study Methods Forty-five adult players were recruited from one 2017 Super Rugby South African team, with 39 included in the final data set. Daily injury and illness data were routinely collected during the season by support staff over a 28-week period (January to July 2017), based on standardized injury and illness definitions. Retrospective analyses of the data were performed. Results The incidence of match injuries (241.0 per 1000 player hours) was significantly higher than training injuries (3.3 per 1000 player hours). Twenty one percent of all injuries occurred during the tackle; 37.5% of all injuries were of a moderate severity. The proportion of players who sustained a time-loss injury was 76.9% (n=30). The overall incidence of illness was 1.8 per 1000 player days. Acute respiratory tract infection (28.6%) was the most common diagnosis, and the majority of illnesses (64.3%) did not result in time-loss. Conclusion This study presented a longer study period than previous research by including the pre-season training, but represented only one single team. The incidence of match injuries was significantly higher than previously reported in Super Rugby tournaments, whereas illness rates were significantly lower. Support staff in professional rugby need to be trained on the standardized Orchard System of Classifications to ensure good quality data that can be compared to other teams within the same or other sporting codes.","[Buchholtz, Kim] Univ Cape Town, Hlth Phys Act Lifestyle & Sport HPALS Res Ctr, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Buchholtz, Kim] LUNEX Int Univ Hlth Exercise & Sports, Dept Physiotherapy, 50 Ave Parc Sports, L-4671 Differdange, Luxembourg; [Barnes, Curt; Burgess, Theresa L.] Univ Cape Town, Div Physiotherapy, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Burgess, Theresa L.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Med Eth & Law, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; Stellenbosch University,"Buchholtz, K (corresponding author), LUNEX Int Univ Hlth Exercise & Sports, Dept Physiotherapy, 50 Ave Parc Sports, L-4671 Differdange, Luxembourg.",kim.buchholtz@lunex-university.net,"Burgess, Theresa/AAT-7698-2020; Buchholtz, Kim/AAV-6309-2020","Buchholtz, Kim/0000-0002-1976-345X; Barnes, Curt Arthur/0000-0001-9578-1679",,,,,20,4,4,0,0,NORTH AMER SPORTS MEDICINE INST-NASMI,NASHVILLE,"6011 HILLSBORO PIKE, NASHVILLE, TN, UNITED STATES",2159-2896,,,INT J SPORTS PHYS TH,Int.

Burden of injury is described by the incidence and severity of injury. However reports have ignored the monetary cost of injuries. Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the monetary cost associated with youth rugby injuries. Design: This descriptive study quantified medical treatments of injured players at the South African Rugby Union Youth tournaments in 2011/2012 and the days of work parents missed as a result of the injuries. A health insurer used these data to calculate associated costs. Methods: Legal guardians of the 421 injured players were contacted telephonically on a weekly basis until they returned to play. Treatments costs were estimated in South African Rands based on 2013 insurance rates and converted to US$ using purchasing power parities. Results: Of the 3652 players, 2% (n = 71) sought medical care after the tournament. For these players, average treatment costs were high (US$731 per player, 95% CI: US$425-US$1096), with fractures being the most expensive type of injury. Players with medical insurance had higher costs (US$937, 95% CI: US$486-US$1500) than those without (US$220, 95% CI: US$145-US$302). Conclusions: Although a minority of players sought follow-up treatment after the tournaments, the cost of these injuries was high. Players without medical insurance having lower costs may indicate that these players did not receive adequate treatment for their injuries. Injury prevention efforts should consider injuries with high costs and the treatment of players without medical insurance. (C) 2014 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The authors study the role of competition in producing the latter two outcomes using two field experiments. In the first, they find that paying tournament prizes for performance induces both men and women to work longer, but that men respond more than women to the high-prize tournament. In the second, men are more likely than women to choose tournament-based compensation over a wage rate for larger prizes. These results demonstrate that high-stakes workplace competition can fuel gender inequality both directly, because men are more likely to enter and win tournaments, and indirectly, by raising work hours, which hurts women who face greater time demands in household production.","[Miller, Amalia R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Petrie, Ragan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX USA; [Segal, Carmit] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Virginia; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Zurich,"Segal, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland.",carmit.segal@business.uzh.ch,"; Petrie, Ragan/AAQ-2892-2021","Miller, Amalia/0000-0003-0094-5226; Petrie, Ragan/0000-0002-9101-1666; Segal, Carmit/0000-0002-0252-4081","Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia [AEARCTR-0004266, 2015-0267-00]",Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia,"We thank various seminar and conference participants and discussant Amanda Agan for helpful comments.

Yet, even in democracies, minority inclusion in politics has historically been challenged by members of majority groups, largely due to perceived threat. Existing literature recognizes psychological factors-namely, values, threats, and norms-driving support for political inclusion, but knowledge of relevant interventions remains limited. We designed psychological interventions, presented as news articles, and tested which ones increased mainstream Jewish majority group members' support for the Palestinian Arab minority's political inclusion in coalition formation in Israel. We employed this context, where the perceived ties between the minority's identity and the identity of the rival in the ongoing conflict make the threat particularly salient, in two critical timepoints: the run-up to a decisive election (Study 1, N = 1248) and during an ongoing war (Study 2, N = 1391). We found that during the run-up to the election, interventions targeting value conflict, tension reduction, and norm perceptions increased support for political inclusion, but none of them had the same effect during the war. These findings illustrate the potential of a real-world intervention tournament, with implications for the promotion of political inclusion in the field.","[Aldar, Lee; Halperin, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Swiss Ctr Conflict Res, Dept Psychol, Jerusalem, Israel; [Aldar, Lee; Pliskin, Ruthie] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Aldar, Lee; Hasson, Yossi; Halperin, Eran] Psychopolit Res Chord Social Psychol Social Change, Shefayim, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Aldar, L; Halperin, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, Mt Scopus Campus, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",lee.aldar@mail.huji.ac.il; eran.halperin@mail.huji.ac.il,"Hasson, Yossi/AAM-5015-2020; Pliskin, Ruthie/T-6228-2019",,European Research Council; [864347],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC));,"This research was conducted in collaboration with the aChord Center: Social Psychology for Social Change and supported by a European Research Council grant (No. 864347) to the last author.

Noncommunicable diseases are the major cause of disability and premature mortality worldwide, associated with negative workplace outcomes such as sickness absence and reduced work productivity. There is a need to identify scalable interventions and their active components to relieve disease and treatment burden and facilitate work participation. eHealth interventions have shown potential in clinical and general populations to increase well-being and physical activity and could be well suited for workplace settings. Objective: We aimed to provide an overview of the effectiveness of eHealth interventions at the workplace targeting employee health behaviors and map behavior change techniques (BCTs) used in these interventions. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL in September 2020 and updated in September 2021. Extracted data included participant characteristics, setting, eHealth intervention type, mode of delivery, reported outcomes, effect sizes, and attrition rates. Quality and risk of bias of the included studies were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias 2 tool. BCTs were mapped in accordance with the BCT Taxonomy v1. The review was reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Results: In total, 17 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The measured outcomes, treatment and follow-up periods, content of eHealth interventions, and workplace contexts had high heterogeneity. Of the 17 studies, 4 (24%) reported unequivocally significant findings for all primary outcomes, with effect sizes ranging from small to large. Furthermore, 53% (9/17) of the studies reported mixed results, and 24% (4/17) reported nonsignificant results. The most frequently targeted behavior was physical activity (15/17, 88% of the studies); the least frequently targeted behavior was smoking (2/17, 12% of the studies). Attrition varied greatly across the studies (0%-37%). Risk of bias was high in 65% (11/17) of the studies, with some concerns in the remaining 35% (6/17). Interventions used various BCTs, and the most frequently used were feedback and monitoring (14/17, 82%), goals and planning (10/17, 59%), antecedents (10/17, 59%), and social support (7/17, 41%). Conclusions: This review suggests that, although eHealth interventions may have potential, there are still unanswered questions regarding their effectiveness and what drives the mechanism behind these effects. Low methodological quality, high heterogeneity and complexity, the characteristics of the included samples, and often high attrition rates challenge the investigation of the effectiveness and the making of sound inferences about the effect sizes and significance of the results.

Therefore, the purpose was to compare the effects of two different doses of CHO on a sports-specific kicking test during a simulated taekwondo tournament compared to placebo (PLA). Methods In a double-blind, randomized-placebo controlled, cross-over trial, eleven junior male professional taekwondo athletes (age: 16 +/- 0.8 years, body mass: 55.3 +/- 7.3 kg) ingested one of three solutions: (i) high dose (C45): 45 g of CHO (60 g center dot h(- 1)), (ii) low dose (C22.5): 22.5 g of CHO (30 g center dot h(- 1); both solutions containing 2:1 glucose:fructose), or a PLA immediately following each kicking test. The kicking test was repeated 5 times, separated by 45 mins of rest, simulating a typical taekwondo competition day. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and gastrointestinal discomfort (GI) scores were collected immediately after, and blood glucose before each test. Results The results revealed that C45 and C22.5 did not improve total, successful, or percentage of successful kicks compared to PLA (p > 0.05). Blood glucose was significantly higher following both CHO conditions compared with PLA across all five tests (p < 0.05). There were no differences between treatments or across tests for RPE (p > 0.05). Conclusion CHO intake, independent of the dose, did not alter taekwondo kick performance during a simulated taekwondo tournament.","[Naderi, Alireza] Islamic Azad Univ, Boroujerd Branch, Dept Sport Physiol, Boroujerd, Iran; [Samanipour, Mohammad Hossein] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Qazvin, Iran; [Sarshin, Amir] Islamic Azad Univ, Karaj Branch, Dept Exercise Physiol, Karaj, Iran; [Forbes, Scott C.] Brandon Univ, Dept Phys Educ Studies, Fac Educ, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Koozehchian, Majid S.] Jacksonville State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Jacksonville, AL 36265 USA; [Franchini, Emerson] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Phys Educ & Sport, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Reale, Reid] UFC Performance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Berjisian, Erfan; Miraftabi, Hossein] Fac Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Dept Exercise Physiol, Tehran, Iran; [de Oliveira, Erick P.] Fed Univ Uberlandia UFU, Sch Med, Lab Nutr Exercise & Hlth LaNES, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Sharafshadeh, Maryam Safari] Elmi Karbordi Univ, Ebne Sina Sports Med Grp, Tehran, Iran; [Rezaei, Sajjad] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Sci, Darwin, NT, Australia",Islamic Azad University; Imam Khomeini International University; Islamic Azad University; Brandon University; Jacksonville State University; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Charles Darwin University,"Naderi, A (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Boroujerd Branch, Dept Sport Physiol, Boroujerd, Iran.",Naderi_a@yahoo.com,"; Samanipour, Mohammad Hossein/AGS-3388-2022; de Oliveira, Erick/D-1138-2011; Berjisian, Erfan/HJA-8076-2022; Franchini, Emerson/B-9119-2012","naderi, alireza/0000-0002-8539-4306; Rezaei, Sajjad/0000-0002-8614-8043; Franchini, Emerson/0000-0002-0769-8398",,,,,40,6,6,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",,1550-2783,,J INT SOC SPORT NUTR,J.

The goal of this study was to quantify water temperatures in live-release tournaments across multiple seasons and then use this information to quantify the impacts of thermal conditions on Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans during live-well holding.Methods To define thermal conditions during live-well holding and the influence of these thermal conditions on Largemouth Bass, a series of complementary field and laboratory studies were conducted. The field study quantified the temperature of live wells in several live-release angling tournaments. The laboratory study used the temperature data from the field to inform holding condition treatments and subsequently quantify the physiological changes in Largemouth Bass induced by thermal conditions in live wells.Results Results from the field showed that thermal conditions in live wells were highly variable, both within and across anglers and tournaments. Several trends in thermal patterns were observed. Laboratory simulations of these patterns showed that cyclical cooling of 4-5 degrees C simulating multiple additions of ice during holding resulted in considerable physiological disturbance and impaired recovery for Largemouth Bass. Disturbances also increased in simulations that increased live-well temperature. Reflex impairment indices were not influenced by any treatment.Conclusions Thermally dynamic recovery environments induce physiological disturbances and prolong recovery from exercise and should be avoided. Given the intense tournament pressure in this system and throughout North America, our results identify key practices that could mitigate tournament practices that would inhibit Largemouth Bass recovery from tournament activities. Tournament-caught Largemouth Bass experience variable live-well temperature regimes; our findings indicate that reducing thermal variation in live wells can result in less stressful holding conditions that may reduce release mortality.","[Hay, Allison A.; Glomb, Jackson C.; Oller, Reagan E.; Suski, Cory D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Hay, AA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",allisonhay10@gmail.com,,"Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X",Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program; Champaign-Urbana Bass Club,Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program; Champaign-Urbana Bass Club,The authors would like to thank Ryan Peterson with the Clinton Lake Jackpot Team Trail and the Champaign-Urbana Bass Club for their contribution with live-well temperature data collection.

We examined the effects of livewell additives on initial and delayed mortality of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. We applied three treatments (salt, ice, or salt and ice) to livewells during tournaments conducted on lakes in Illinois, United States, as well as in laboratory and pond experiments designed to examine the effects of fish size and ambient water temperature on mortality. Fish were collected after tournament weigh-in procedures were completed and monitored for delayed mortality every 24 h for 5 d. Initial mortality did not differ among livewell additives during these field experiments. Although delayed mortality was high (35%), it was not significantly different among livewells that contained salt (56%), ice (48%), ice and salt (40%), and controls (30%). Additives administered during the laboratory experiments, at cool water temperatures, resulted in significantly lower delayed mortalities than those observed during the field experiments when ambient water temperatures were warmer. Initial and delayed mortality did not differ among livewell additives during the laboratory experiments. Larger fish in field experiments had significantly greater delayed mortality than smaller fish in the pond experiments even though initial and delayed mortality did not differ among livewell additives. Our results suggest that fish size and ambient water temperature have a greater influence on delayed mortality observed during competitive angling events than the specific livewell additives studied here.","[Ostrand, Kenneth G.; Siepker, Michael J.; Wahl, David H.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Sam Parr Biol Stn, Kinmundy, IL 62854 USA",Illinois Natural History Survey,"Ostrand, KG (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ecol Physiol Program, Abernathy Fish Technol Ctr, 1440 Abernathy Creek Rd, Longview, WA 98632 USA.",kenneth_ostrand@fws.gov,"Siepker, Michael/O-6042-2019",,Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration Project [F-135-R],Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration Project,"This project benefited from the technical assistance of all tournament sponsors and anglers, as well as Sam Parr and Kaskaskia Biological Station staff.

Twenty male junior soccer players were assigned to one of two treatment groups and undertook either cold-water immersion (5x1min at 10 degrees C) or thermoneutral water immersion (5x1min at 34 degrees C) after each match. High-intensity running distance (15km center dot h-1) and total distance covered, time spent in low (80% maximum heart rate), moderate (80-90% maximum heart rate), and high (90% maximum heart rate) heart rate zones, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded for each match. Perceptions of general fatigue and leg soreness were recorded approximately 22h after each match. There were decreases in both groups across the 4-day tournament for high-intensity running distance (P=0.006, Cohen's d=0.63), total distance run (P0.001, d=0.90), time in high heart rate zone (P=0.003, d=0.90), and match RPE (P=0.012, d=0.52). Cold-water immersion was more effective than thermoneutral immersion for reducing the perception of leg soreness (P=0.004, d=-0.92) and general fatigue (P=0.007, d=-0.91), ameliorating the decrement in total distance run (P=0.001, d=0.55), and maintaining time in the moderate heart rate zone (P=0.01, d=1.06).

Moreover, some community members now organise the 'Original Redneck Fishin' Tournament', an annual event geared toward challenging the continued invasion of Asian carp. We use this tournament as a window into the manner self-identified redneck communities negotiate the co-constitutive cultural, political, and material dynamism of local environmental relationships. Findings reveal a great diversity of nuanced ways a specifically redneck identity, politics, and environmental embeddedness build through each other, relationships that must be furthermore contextualised within broader socioenvironmental histories of state and urban interventions upon rural life.","[Besek, Jordan Fox] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 430 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Cunningham, Jeanine] Univ Oregon, Dept Sociol, 1415 Kincaid St, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; University at Buffalo, SUNY; University of Oregon","Besek, JF (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 430 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jfbesek@buffalo.edu,,"Fox Wischerath, Jordan/0000-0001-6704-6095",,,,,42,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0199,1467-9523,,SOCIOL RURALIS,Sociol.

We conducted a large pre-registered experiment (N = 4,081) to measure the effectiveness of seven nudges: making descriptive norms, injunctive norms, or personal norms salient, cooling down negative emotions, stimulating deliberation or empathy, and highlighting reputation. We used an online platform that reproduces a social media newsfeed and presented the nudge as a message when entering the platform. Our findings indicate that none of the nudges significantly impacts participants' engagement with harmful content. At the same time, nudges making descriptive norms salient selectively increase participants' overall engagement with relatively harmless content. Additionally, making injunctive norms salient increased the likelihood of liking harmless posts. Exploratory text analysis also reveals that highlighting reputation leads to more substantial and coherent comments on harmful posts. These results suggest that nudges that activate norm considerations represent a promising approach to promoting civil discourse and making social media a safer and more inclusive space for all.","[Celadin, Tatiana] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Panizza, Folco] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Mol Mind Lab, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Capraro, Valerio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Psychol, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Capraro, V (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Psychol, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",valerio.capraro@unimib.it,"Panizza, Folco/ABC-8366-2021","Panizza, Folco/0000-0001-5178-5926; Celadin, Tatiana/0000-0002-7743-3117; Capraro, Valerio/0000-0002-0579-0166",RKEFF Middlesex University Research Grant,RKEFF Middlesex University Research Grant,This research was funded by the RKEFF Middlesex University Research Grant,,51,2,2,4,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2752-6542,,PNAS NEXUS,PNAS Nexus,1-Oct,2024,3,10,,,,,,,pgae380,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae380,,,9,"Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,H3U2X,39359395,"gold, Green Submitted",,,7/25/25,WOS:001322718300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Linking the experimental data with student-level administrative data allows us to study two aspects of competitive environments: tournament structure and one's perceived position in the ability distribution. At least in our setting, we find only limited evidence that effort responses to competition are sensitive to tournament size or prize structure. However, in contrast to previous studies that examine effort responses to exogenously assigned competition, we find a large negative competition effect for students who believe they are relatively low in the ability distribution, and no competition effect for those who believe they are relatively high ability. Using additional treatments, we further show that the divergence between our results and past results is likely driven by task type and not by differences in selection into participation between lab and classroom environments.

Effects of the recovery strategies on pre-post tournament performance tests were expressed as the mean change (% +/- standard deviation of the change score). Changes and differences were standardized for accumulated game time, assessed against the smallest worthwhile change for each test, and reported qualitatively. Accumulated fatigue was evident over the tournament with small to moderate impairments in performance tests. Sprint and agility performance decreased by 0.7% (s = 1.3) and 2.0% (s = 1.9) respectively. Vertical jump decreased substantially after the first day for all treatments, and remained suppressed post-tournament. Cold water immersion was substantially better in maintaining 20-m acceleration with only a 0.5% (s = 1.4) reduction in 20-m time after 3 days compared with a 3.2% (s = 1.6) reduction for compression. Cold water immersion (-1.4%, s 1.7) and compression (-1.5%, s 1.7) showed similar substantial benefits in maintaining line-drill performance over the tournament, whereas carbohydrate+stretching elicited a 0.4% (s = 1.8) reduction. Sit-and-reach flexibility decreased for all groups, although cold water immersion resulted in the smallest reduction in flexibility. Basketball tournament play elicited small to moderate impairments in physical test performance. In conclusion, cold water immersion appears to promote better restoration of physical performance measures than carbohydrate+stretching routines and compression garments.","[Montgomery, Paul G.; Pyne, David B.] Australian Inst Sport, Dept Physiol, Belconnen, ACT, Australia; [Hopkins, Will G.] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Cook, Katherine] Australian Inst Sport, Dept Nutr, Belconnen, ACT, Australia; [Minahan, Clare L.] Griffith Univ, Dept Physiotherapy & Exercise Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Australian Institute of Sport; Auckland University of Technology; Australian Institute of Sport; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Montgomery, PG (corresponding author), AIS, POB 176, Belconnen, ACT 2616, Australia.",paul.montgomery@ausport.gov.au,,"Pyne, David/0000-0003-1555-5079; Minahan, Clare/0000-0002-4777-4033",,,,,38,166,187,0,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-0414,1466-447X,,J SPORT SCI,J.

No systematic comparison of accuracy, agreement, and sensitivity to small changes in hypothesized effect sizes for these methods is available. Our aim is to conduct such a systematic comparative analysis and to introduce a comprehensive freely available online tool to facilitate appropriate power analyses for ordinal outcomes.Methods: We performed simulation studies utilizing the control arm modified Rankin Scale distributions from the AVERT (A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial), EXTEND (Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits), and HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) studies, as well as a uniform distribution, in combination with hypothetical treatment effects. We systematically evaluated published power formulas for Ordinal Logistic Regression and Tournament Methods (generalized odds ratio; Win Probability; Win Ratio; and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test). We also developed an online and downloadable Shiny R app facilitating sample size calculation for, and ordinal analysis of, modified Rankin Scale data.Results: Power formulas for Tournament Methods performed well, while the formula for ordinal logistic regression was inaccurate. Tang's Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test sample size formula exhibited the highest accuracy. All methods, including ordinal logistic regression, had almost identical empirical power for a given sample size. All power methods exhibited sensitivity to small changes in hypothesized effect size. The developed freely available online app supports analytical and visualization requirements for all investigated methods for power and statistical analyses of ordinal modified Rankin Scale outcomes.Conclusions: As Tournament Method sample size formulas are assumption-free and accurately calculate power, stroke researchers should use these methods when designing studies with outcomes measured on the full or partially collapsed modified Rankin Scale as well as other ordinal scales, even if they intend to use ordinal logistic regression for analysis. Conducting sensitivity analyses of the effect size assumptions are essential for appropriate sample size estimation. Our developed tool supports both of these recommendations ().","[Johns, Hannah; Churilov, Leonid] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Med Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Johns, Hannah; Campbell, Bruce; Churilov, Leonid] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne Brain Ctr, Australian Stroke Alliance, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Campbell, Bruce] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne Brain Ctr, Dept Med & Neurol, Parkville, Australia; [Turc, Guillaume] GHU Paris Psychiat & Neurosci, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Turc, Guillaume] Univ Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Turc, Guillaume] INSERM, U1266, Paris, France; [Turc, Guillaume] FHU Neurovasc, Paris, France; [Johns, Hannah] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne Med Sch, Melbourne Brain Ctr, 300 Grattan St, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia",University of Melbourne; Melbourne Health; Royal Melbourne Hospital; Melbourne Health; Royal Melbourne Hospital; Universite Paris Cite; GHU PARIS Psychiatrie Neurosciences; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Melbourne Health; Royal Melbourne Hospital,"Johns, H (corresponding author), Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne Med Sch, Melbourne Brain Ctr, 300 Grattan St, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.",hannah.johns@unimelb.edu.au; bruce.campbell@mh.org.au; g.turc@ghu-paris.fr; leonidc@unimelb.edu.au,"Campbell, Bruce/J-1220-2019; Johns, Hannah Tabitha/AAU-9273-2020; Johns, Hannah/AAU-9273-2020","Campbell, Bruce/0000-0003-3632-9433; Johns, Hannah Tabitha/0000-0003-2135-0504; Turc, Guillaume/0000-0001-5059-4095;",,,,,42,5,6,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0039-2499,1524-4628,,STROKE,Stroke,JUL,2023,54,7,,,,,1750,1760,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041260,,,11,Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,K6UE1,37264911,,,,7/25/25,WOS:001017763100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence for the effect of statins of CVD in the diabetic population in low-risk population (e.g., Japanese) is limited. We evaluated the effect of pravastatin on risk reduction of CVD related to baseline glucose status in a primary prevention setting. The Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) Study, in patients with mild-to-moderated hypercholesterolemia (220-270 mg/dL), showed that low-dose pravastatin significantly reduced the risk for CVD by 26%. This exploratory subanalyses examined the efficacy of diet plus pravastatin on CVD in 2210 patients with abnormal fasting glucose (AFG, including 1746 patients with DM and 464 patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at 5 years in the MEGA Study, CVD was threefold higher in AFG patients (threefold higher in DM, and twofold higher in IFG) compared with normal fasting glucose (NFG) patients in the diet group. Diet plus pravastatin treatment significantly reduced the risk of CVD by 32% (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% Cl 0.48-0.96, number needed to treat, 42) in the AFG group compared with the diet alone group, and no significant interaction between AFG and NFG (interaction P = 0.85) was found. Safety problems were not observed during long-term treatment with pravastatin. In conclusion, pravastatin reduces the risk of CVD in subjects with hypercholesterolemia and abnormal fasting glucose in the primary prevention setting in Japan.

Materials and methods Twenty elite female soccer players (aged 25.2 +/- 3.1 years) wore wrist actigraph units and heart rate (HR) monitors during night-sleep throughout 9 consecutive days (6 day-time training sessions [DT], 2 day-time matches [DM], and 1 evening-time match [EM]) of an international tournament. Training and match loads were monitored using the session-rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and wearable 18-Hz GPS (total distance covered [TD], training and match exposure time, and high-speed running [HSR]) to characterize training and match loads. Results Individually, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR during training sessions ranged from 20 to 680 arbitrary units (AU), 892 to 5176 m, 20 to 76 min, and 80 to 1140 m, respectively. During matches, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR ranged from 149 to 876 AU, 2236 to 11210 m, 20 to 98 min, and 629 to 3213 m, respectively. Individually, players slept less than recommended (< 7 hours) on several days of the tournament, especially after EM (n = 8; TST ranging between 6:00-6:54 h). Total sleep time coefficient of variation (CV) ranged between 3.1 and 18.7%. However, all players presented good sleep quality (i.e., sleep efficiency.75%; individual range between: 75-98%) on each day of the tournament. Most of the players presented small fluctuations in nocturnal cardiac autonomic activity (individual nocturnal heart rate variability [HRV] ranged from 3.91-5.37 ms and HRV CV ranged from 2.8-9.0%), while two players presented higher HRV CV (11.5 and 11.7%; respectively). Conclusion Overall, this study highlights the substantial individual variability in sleep and HRV measures, suggesting the adoption of an individual approach to monitor sleep, training and match loads and recovery, to better understand how players cope with highly demanding competitions.","[Costa, Julio; Rago, Vincenzo; Rebelo, Antonio] Univ Porto, Fac Sport, CIFI2D, Ctr Res Educ Innovat & Intervent Sport, Porto, Portugal; [Costa, Julio; Figueiredo, Pedro; Rago, Vincenzo; Brito, Joao] Portuguese Football Federat, FPF, Portugal Football Sch, Oeiras, Portugal; [Figueiredo, Pedro] Univ Inst Maia, Res Ctr Sports Sci Hlth Sci & Human Dev, CIDESD, ISMAI, Maia, Portugal; [Nakamura, Fabio] Associate Grad Program Phys Educ UPE UFPB, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",Universidade do Porto; Instituto Universitario da Maia (ISMAI),"Costa, J (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Sport, CIFI2D, Ctr Res Educ Innovat & Intervent Sport, Porto, Portugal.;Costa, J (corresponding author), Portuguese Football Federat, FPF, Portugal Football Sch, Oeiras, Portugal.",jahdc@hotmail.com,"Nakamura, Fábio/AAC-3069-2020; brito, joao/IQU-5611-2023; Costa, Julio A./J-4568-2019; Rago, Vincenzo/C-6463-2017; Brito, Joao/D-2104-2014; Rebelo, Antonio/N-8975-2013; Rago, Vincenzo/AAC-8370-2020; Costa, Júlio/J-4568-2019; Figueiredo, Pedro/J-4178-2013","Costa, Julio A./0000-0002-8225-8667; Rago, Vincenzo/0000-0002-9445-4008; Brito, Joao/0000-0003-1301-1078; Rebelo, Antonio/0000-0001-9105-7421; Figueiredo, Pedro/0000-0001-5515-3694; Nakamura, Fabio Yuzo/0000-0002-5336-3652","FIFA Research Scholarship 2017 (International Centre for Sports Studies [CIES]); FIFA Research Scholarship 2017 (Federation Internationale de Football Association [FIFA]); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/128531/2017, SFRH/BD/129324/2017]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/128531/2017, SFRH/BD/129324/2017] Funding Source: FCT",FIFA Research Scholarship 2017 (International Centre for Sports Studies [CIES]); FIFA Research Scholarship 2017 (Federation Internationale de Football Association [FIFA]); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,FIFA Research Scholarship 2017 (International Centre for Sports Studies [CIES] and Federation Internationale de Football Association [FIFA]) funding was provided for this study.

Although NBIBDs were introduced in the statistical literature in 1967 and have subsequently received occasional attention there, they are almost unknown in the combinatorial literature, except in the literature of tournaments, and detailed combinatorial studies of them have been lacking. The present paper therefore reviews and extends mathematical knowledge of NBIBDs. Isomorphism and automorphisms are defined for NBIBDs, and methods of construction are outlined. Some special types of NBIBD are defined and illustrated.

Fat snook is the primary target species in southeastern Brazil and it supports a vibrant fisheries sector, including recreational fishing tournaments. To evaluate the impacts of recreational angling practices, we examined external hooking injuries, secondary physiological stress responses (i.e., blood glucose and lactate concentrations; N = 24), reflex impairment (N = 39), and overnight survival (N = 39) of fat snook angled with and without air exposure. We also examined physiological stress and reflex impairment of fat snook captured in a fishing tournament (N = 43) immediately post weigh-in and 1 h post weigh-in. Values were compared to baseline reflexes (N = 10) and physiology (N = 8) collected from minimally stressed fat snook. Fish captured by anglers infrequently had hooking injury but all angling and tournament treatments resulted in significantly elevated blood glucose and lactate, indicating a considerable physiological response to angling. Angling with air exposure and tournament weigh-in (in a dry container) resulted in the highest blood lactate values. The body flex reflex was occasionally impaired after angling or tournament practices, but this was consistent with baseline reflex actions, and the body flex reflex was therefore not a valuable indicator of fisheries stress or mortality in fat snook. Although angling and tournament practices caused a marked physiological stress response, low mortality of snook indicated that the species is resilient to brief bouts of angling at moderate water temperatures. However, high lactate values associated with air exposure suggest that handling practices be refined, particularly during tournament weigh-in. We recommend that anglers reduce air exposure intervals when handling snook prior to release and that recreational tournaments adopt wet weigh-in procedures to maximize the utility of catch-and-release in this fishery.

The [La-]] remained elevated at 30 min, compared to PRE (+1.7 [1.4-2.0] mmol & BULL;L-1, P < .001), with -20% of values persisting >4 mmol & BULL;L-1. Higher POST was observed in males compared to females (+1.6 [0.1-3.2] mmol & BULL;L-1, P = .042); however, no differences between sexes were found across 30 min or PRE [La-]]. No [La-]] differences between positions (backs and forwards) were identified. Conclusions: Lactate concentrations above 10 mmol & BULL;L-1 are required to effectively simulate the anaerobic demands of international Rugby Sevens matches. Practitioners are advised to individualize anaerobic training prescription due to the substantial variability observed within positional groups. Additionally, improving athletes' metabolic recovery capacity through training, nutrition, and recovery interventions may enhance physical preparation for subsequent matches within a day, where incomplete lactate clearance was observed.","[James, Carl; Chong, Henry] Hong Kong Sports Inst HKSI, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rees, James] Hong Kong Rugby Union HKRU, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Taylor, Lee] Loughborough Univ, Natl Ctr Sport & Exercise Med NCSEM, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, England; [Taylor, Lee; Henderson, Mitch] Univ Technol Sydney UTS, Fac Hlth, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Beaven, Christopher M.] Univ Waikato, Te Huataki Waiora Sch Hlth, Tauranga, New Zealand; [Henderson, Mitch] Univ Technol Sydney UTS, Human Performance Res Ctr, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Baker, Julien S.] Hong Kong Baptist Univ HKBU, Ctr Hlth & Exercise Sci Res, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Loughborough University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Waikato; University of Technology Sydney,"James, C (corresponding author), Hong Kong Sports Inst HKSI, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",carlalexanderjames@gmail.com,"Beaven, Christopher/Q-3109-2016; James, Carl/AAU-4540-2020","Beaven, Christopher/0000-0003-2900-7460; James, Carl/0000-0003-2099-5343; Taylor, Lee/0000-0002-8483-7187",,,,,45,0,0,1,3,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1555-0265,1555-0273,,INT J SPORT PHYSIOL,Int.

Furthermore, there is no guarantee a manually generated schedule maximises the operational efficiency of the centre. Scheduling problems have seen extensive research across several domains. The current work presents a novel genetic algorithm for the scheduling of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) appointments. The proposed List Scheduling Wildcard Tournament Genetic Algorithm (LSWT-GA) combines an innovative survivor selection policy with heuristic population initialisation. The algorithm aims to optimise the operational efficiency of a medical centre through efficient rTMS appointment scheduling. Additionally, the algorithm has the capacity to consider patient priority. Empirical experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, using a synthetic data set specifically developed to simulate the medical treatment scheduling problem. The experimental results showed the LSWT-GA algorithm outperforms other algorithms, obtaining the optimal makespan more frequently than a List Scheduling Genetic Algorithm (LS-GA) using traditional survivor selection policies and a standard genetic algorithm using random population initialisation (Random-GA). In addition to the novel genetic algorithm, LSWT-GA, the paper also makes a theoretical contribution by evaluating the run time of the LSWT-GA for makespan minimisation. The proposed algorithm and related findings can be applied directly to the administration systems in medical and healthcare centres and helps improve the deployment of medical resources for better treatment effect.","[Squires, Matthew; Tao, Xiaohui] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Elangovan, Soman] Belmont Private Hosp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gururajan, Raj; Zhou, Xujuan] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Business, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Acharya, Udyavara Rajendra] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore",University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS),"Tao, XH (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia.",matthew.squires@usq.edu.au; xiaohui.tao@usq.edu.au; soman.elangovan@healthecare.com.au; Raj.Gururajan@usq.edu.au; xujuan.zhou@usq.edu.au; Rajendra_Udyavara_ACHARYA@np.edu.sg,"Tao, Xiaohui/JKI-2330-2023; Zhou, Xujuan/HIZ-7836-2022; Acharya, Rajendra/E-3791-2010","Zhou, Xujuan/0000-0002-1736-739X; Acharya, U Rajendra/0000-0003-2689-8552; Squires, Matthew/0000-0002-2084-1697; Tao, Xiaohui/0000-0002-0020-077X;","Belmont Private Hospital, Brisbane","Belmont Private Hospital, Brisbane","This work is partially funded by Belmont Private Hospital, Brisbane.

Minimally invasive total gastrectomy (MIG) aims to reduce postoperative morbidity, but its use has not yet been widely established in Western countries. Minimally invasivE versus open total GAstrectomy is the first Western multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare postoperative morbidity following MIG vs open total gastrectomy (OG). Methods and analysis This superiority multicentre RCT compares MIG (intervention) to OG (control) for oncological total gastrectomy with D2 or D2+LAD. Recruitment is expected to last for 2 years. Inclusion criteria comprise age between 18 and 84 years and planned total gastrectomy after initial diagnosis of gastric carcinoma. Exclusion criteria include Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >2, tumours requiring extended gastrectomy or less than total gastrectomy, previous abdominal surgery or extensive adhesions seriously complicating MIG, other active oncological disease, advanced stages (T4 or M1), emergency setting and pregnancy. The sample size was calculated at 80 participants per group. The primary endpoint is 30-day postoperative morbidity as measured by the Comprehensive Complications Index. Secondary endpoints include postoperative morbidity and mortality, adherence to a fast-track protocol and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) scores (QoR-15, EUROQOL EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D), EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-STO22, activities of daily living and Body Image Scale). Oncological endpoints include rate of R0 resection, lymph node yield, disease-free survival and overall survival at 60-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been received by the independent Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Heidelberg (S-816/2021) and will be received from each responsible ethics committee for each individual participating centre prior to recruitment.

A total of 7216 players participated in 531 matches between 2011 and 2014.Interventions:None.Main Outcome Measures:Concussion incidence was calculated per 1000 player-match-hours with 95% CIs. Poisson regression was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between factors (age, time period, playing position, and activity at the time of concussion) potentially associated with concussions.Results:The concussion incidence was 6.8/1000 player-match-hours (95% CI, 5.5-8.1) across all age groups. Under-13s (IRR, 1.5; P = 0.09) and under-16s (IRR, 1.7; P = 0.03) had higher concussion incidence rates than the under-18 age group. The incidence was higher in the third (IRR, 2.1; P = 0.04) and fourth (IRR, 2.5; P = 0.01) quarters of matches compared with the first quarter. Sixty-two percent of concussions occurred in the tackle situation. The tackler had a 4-fold greater concussion rate (IRR, 4.3; P < 0.001) compared with the ball carrier. The hooker and loose forwards had higher incidence rates than several other player positions (P < 0.05).Conclusions:The reported concussion incidence falls within the broad range previously reported in youth rugby. The evidence highlighted in this study may contribute to targeted concussion prevention strategies and provide a baseline against which the effectiveness of future interventions can be measured.","[Mc Fie, Sarah; Brown, James; Hendricks, Sharief; Posthumus, Michael; Readhead, Clint; Lambert, Mike; September, Alison V.; Viljoen, Wayne] Univ Cape Town, Div Exercise Sci & Sports Med, Dept Human Biol, Fac Hlth Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Readhead, Clint; Viljoen, Wayne] South African Rugby Football Union, Dept Med, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Viljoen, W (corresponding author), SARU House,163 Uys Krige Dr,Tygerberg Pk, ZA-7500 Cape Town, South Africa.",waynev@sarugby.co.za,"; Hendricks, Sharief/U-3278-2019; Lambert, Mike/B-8860-2012; Brown, James/H-7637-2019","Brown, James/0000-0002-7778-7783; Hendricks, Sharief/0000-0002-3416-6266; Viljoen, Wayne/0000-0002-9432-6153; September, Alison V/0000-0003-0950-286X;",South African National Research Foundation; University of Cape Town; Thembakazi Trust,South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa); University of Cape Town; Thembakazi Trust,S.M. was funded by the South African National Research Foundation and the University of Cape Town.

In addition, some nests had broods reduced (removal of the majority of the eggs or fry from the nest) during the angling treatments to simulate predation of offspring during the angling event. Fish subjected to procedures simulating fishing tournaments (including a 1-h livewell confinement and release 100 in from the nest) exhibited significantly longer rest periods prior to returning to their nest than did other treatment groups. This rest period was longer for largemouth bass than smallmouth bass. Brood removal and air exposure increased abandonment rates compared with controls. These results show that sublethal stressors inherent in some angling practices (such as air exposure and livewell confinement) may delay the return of male black bass to their nest. In the presence of nest predators, the delay in return time could result in increased nest abandonment.","Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa Carleton Inst Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol & Conservat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Aquat Ecosyst Res Branch, Peterborough, ON, Canada; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol & Conservat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Ottawa; Carleton University; Carleton University; Illinois Natural History Survey; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Hanson, KC (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa Carleton Inst Biol, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",khanson2@connect.carleton.ca,"Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X",,,,,35,43,48,0,19,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-997X,,,FISHERIES MANAG ECOL,Fisheries Manag.

We present a large field experiment (N = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.","[Milkman, Katherine L.; Gandhi, Linnea; Ho, Hung; Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA;

This paper describes the results of a survey of all athletes competing in elite international competitions between 2009 and 2021. Sixty-eight athletes completed surveys, representing a response rate of 80%. The rate of water safety team interventions was calculated at one intervention per 295 high dives for the men (0.34%) and one intervention per 265 high dives for the women (0.38%). After safety team intervention, 26% of the male and 42% of the female divers required hospital evaluation. Circumstances reported by high divers that may contribute to an incident were performing a new dive (<10 repetitions), body position at water entry, and environmental factors such as water movement and cold ambient temperature. Statistically, a water safety team will intervene once or twice per 4-d tournament. Injury and illness surveillance both during tournaments and year-round is recommended.","[Zimmermann, Wes O.] Royal Netherlands Army, Dept Mil Sports Med, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Zimmermann, Wes O.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Mil & Emergency Med, Bethesda, MD USA; [Lobue, Steven] Ft Lauderdale High Diving, Ft Lauderdale, FL USA; [Gerrard, David] Univ Otago, Med Sch, Dept Med, Dunedin, New Zealand",Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA; University of Otago,"Zimmermann, WO (corresponding author), Vogelkersstr 88, NL-2565 CM The Hague, Netherlands.",wesselzimmermann@hotmail.com; ftlhighdiving@gmail.com; dcolturi@gmail.com; mitrione@me.com; david.gerrard@otago.ac.nz,"Zimmermann, Wes/AAL-1912-2021",,,,The authors declare no conflict of interest and do not have any financial disclosures.

Although part of this effect may be explained by gender differences in risk attitudes and self-confidence, previous studies have attributed the majority of the gender gap to gender differences in a competitiveness trait. I re-examine this result using a novel experiment that allows me to separate competitiveness from alternative explanations using causal treatments. In contradiction to the main conclusion drawn in a long literature, my results imply that the entire gender gap is driven by gender differences in risk attitudes and self-confidence, which has implications for policy and research.","[van Veldhuizen, Roel] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [van Veldhuizen, Roel] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany",Lund University,"van Veldhuizen, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden.;van Veldhuizen, R (corresponding author), WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.",roel.van_veldhuizen@nek.lu.se,,"van Veldhuizen, Roel/0000-0003-3532-8324",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CRC TRR 190],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank the editor (Paola Giuliano), three anonymous reviewers, Marina Agranov, Kai Barron, Vojtech Bartos, Nina Bonge, Yves Breitmoser, Thomas Buser, David Danz, Marie-Pierre Dargnies, Thomas Dohmen, Dirk Engelmann, Hande Erkut, Jana Friedrichsen, Uri Gneezy, Rustam Hakimov, Bob Hammond, Simone Haeckl, H degrees akan Holm, Macartan Humphreys, Botond K oszegi, Dorothea K ubler, John List, Johanna Mollerstrom, Muriel Niederle, Eva Ranehill, Maria Recalde, Martin Schonger, Andrew Schotter, Simeon Schudy, Erik Snowberg, Joep Sonnemans, Robert St uber, Petra Thiemann, Bertil Tungodden, Jo el van der Weele, Lise Vesterlund, Melinda Vigh~, and Erik Wengstr om for valuable comments.

Methods: We conducted a large-scale randomized primary prevention trial in Japan (MEGA Study), in which we randomly allocated 7832 mild hypercholesterolemic patients to diet alone (n = 3966) and diet plus pravastatin groups (n = 3866) and followed them for an average of 5 years. We compared baseline levels and the CVD incidence in the diet alone group, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves in the overall population. To determine the best parameter for predicting the efficacy of pravastatin, the diet plus pravastatin group was divided into tertiles to compare lipid parameters and CVD incidence versus the diet alone group. Results: Significantly graded correlations were found between CVD and LDL-C/HDL-C and non-HDL-C. Significantly more CVD events were associated with LDL-C/HDL-C > 186 mg/dL and LDL-C/HDL-C > 2.9. Furthermore, LDL-C/HDL-C or non-HDL-C was more predictive than LDL-C. By measuring LDL-C/HDL-C or non-HDL-C, we allocated 32% of the diet plus pravastatin group into a different risk category. The lowest significant incidence of CVD was found in patients with LDL-C 119.8-133.4 mg/dL, LDL-C/HDL-C < 1.9, and non-HDL-C 145.2-160.8 mg/dL. Conclusion: Non-HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C have a greater ability to predict CVD risk in mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemic Japanese individuals than LDL-C, and are more useful to evaluate the effect of pravastatin; however, these parameters should be interpreted independently when assessing CVD risk.","[Mizuno, Kyoichi] Nippon Med Sch, Dept Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138602, Japan; [Nakaya, Noriaki] Nakaya Clin, Tokyo, Japan; [Teramoto, Tamio] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Tokyo 173, Japan; [Yokoyama, Shinji] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Ohashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Prevent Hlth Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Ueki, Akio] Tokyo Med Univ, Hachioji Med Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Takahashi, Soichiro] Mitsuke City Hosp, Life Style Related Dis Ctr, Mitsuke, Japan; [Kubota, Yukio] Kureha Gen Hosp, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan; [Nakamura, Haruo] Mitsukoshi Hlth & Welf Fdn, Tokyo, Japan",Nippon Medical School; Teikyo University; Nagoya City University; University of Tokyo; Tokyo Medical University,"Mizuno, K (corresponding author), Nippon Med Sch, Dept Med, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.",mizunok@nms.ac.jp,,,,,,,31,12,13,1,3,JAPAN ATHEROSCLEROSIS SOC,TOKYO,"NICHINAI-KAIKAN B1, 3-28-8 HONGO BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1340-3478,1880-3873,,J ATHEROSCLER THROMB,J.

As the incidence of CHD in Japan is about one-third lower and that of stroke is two-fold higher compared to Western countries, and the doses of lipid-lowering drugs used in foreign randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are much higher than in general use in Japan, it remains unclear whether the results of RCTs conducted in Western countries could be extrapolated to Japanese patients. Recently, two major large-scale, prospective, RCTs in Japanese hypercholesterolmic patients, the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention of Adult Japanese (MEGA) study and the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), have been reported. Japanese epidemiological studies and Japanese clinical studies are reviewed. The evidence suggests that hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-cholesterol are strongly associated with increased CHD risk. Lipid-lowering medication shows beneficial effects even in low-risk populations; however, the data did not support that lower cholesterol is better. The safety and efficacy of hyperlipidemia treatment in Japanese patients are discussed.","Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Grad Sch Publ Hlth Med, Chuo Ku, Fukuoka 8100072, Japan; Showa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med 3, Tokyo 142, Japan",International University of Health & Welfare; Showa University,"Sasaki, J (corresponding author), Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Grad Sch Publ Hlth Med, Chuo Ku, 1-3-1 Nagahama, Fukuoka 8100072, Japan.",jsas@nifty.com,"Koba, Shinji/GZK-2961-2022",,,,,,69,18,18,0,7,JAPAN ATHEROSCLEROSIS SOC,TOKYO,"NICHINAI-KAIKAN B1, 3-28-8 HONGO BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1340-3478,1880-3873,,J ATHEROSCLER THROMB,J.

However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions' effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior-several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people's initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors.","[Vlasceanu, Madalina; Doell, Kimberly C.; Berkebile-Weinberg, Michael M.; Patel, Yash; Goldwert, Danielle; Pei, Yifei; Rathje, Steve; Fang, Ke; Jost, John T.; Shuman, Eric; Van Bavel, Jay J.] New York Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Doell, Kimberly C.; Todorova, Boryana; Pronizius, Ekaterina; Lamm, Claus; Nitschke, Jonas P.] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Cognit Emot & Methods Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Bak-Coleman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Craig Newmark Ctr Journalism Eth & Secur, New York, NY 10018 USA; [Bak-Coleman, Joseph B.] Harvard Univ, Inst Rebooting Social Media, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Grayson, Samantha J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [van den Broek, Karlijn L.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vlasceanu, Denisa] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Constantino, Sara] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Constantino, Sara] Northeastern Univ, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Morais, Michael J.] Amazon, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Schumann, Philipp] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Psychol, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Aglioti, Salvatore Maria] Santa Lucia Fdn, IRCCS, I-179 Rome, Italy; [Aglioti, Salvatore Maria] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Psychol, I-185 Rome, Italy; [Alfano, Mark] Macquarie Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Alvarado-Yepez, Andy J.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, San Martin De Porres 15102, Peru; [Andersen, Angelica] Univ Fed Parana, Postgrad Program Linguist, BR-80060150 Curitiba, Brazil; [Anseel, Frederik] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Apps, Matthew A.

J,"Duckworth, AL; Milkman, KL",,,,"Duckworth, Angela L.; Milkman, Katherine L.",,,A guide to megastudies,PNAS NEXUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERVENTIONS,"How can behavioral insights best be leveraged to solve pressing policy challenges? Because research studies are typically designed to test the validity of a particular idea, surprisingly little is known about the relative efficacy of different approaches to changing behavior in any given policy context. We discuss megastudies as a research approach that can surmount this and other obstacles to developing optimal behaviorally informed policy interventions. We define a megastudy as a massive field experiment in which many different treatments are tested synchronously in one large sample using a common, objectively measured outcome. We summarize this apples-to-apples approach to research and lay out recommendations, limitations, and promising future directions for scholars who might want to conduct or evaluate megastudies. Significance Statement: From voter turnout to vaccine adoption, public policy challenges of all kinds benefit from effective interventions for changing human behavior. The aim of a conventional intervention study is to test a single approach-not to compare the efficacy of different interventions. To address this lack of comparability, we propose a new paradigm: megastudies are massive field experiments in which many different treatments are tested synchronously in a large sample using a common objective outcome. We summarize this apples-to-apples approach to research and lay out recommendations, limitations, and promising future directions for scholars who might want to conduct or evaluate megastudies.","[Duckworth, Angela L.; Milkman, Katherine L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Milkman, KL (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kmilkman@wharton.upenn.edu,"Duckworth, Angela/AFK-9545-2022; Milkman, Katherine/LEL-9898-2024",,,,,,41,18,18,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2752-6542,,PNAS NEXUS,PNAS Nexus,NOV,2022,1,5,,,,,,,pgac214,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac214,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac214,,Nov-22,5,"Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,R3LH2,36712333,"Green Published, gold",,,7/25/25,WOS:001063395200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We consider a multi-player Tullock contest in which players differ in their prize valuations. The designer is allowed to impose identity-dependent treatments - i.e., multiplicative biases - to vary their relative competitiveness. The literature has been limited, because a closed-form solution to the equilibrium is in general unavailable when the number of contestants exceeds two, which nullifies the usual implicit programming approach. We develop an algorithmic technique adapted from the general approach of Fu and Wu (2020) and obtain a closed-form solution to the optimum that addresses a broad array of design objectives. We further analyze a resource allocation problem in a research tournament and adapt Fu and Wu's (2020) approach to this noncanonical setting.

Nowadays latest sports technology has significantly influenced the performance of players in competitions. Sports technology positively influences the preparation of players, manufacturing of quality infrastructure and assistance for match officials for giving a fair and accurate decision. Among all above areas, official decisions are more important as these finally decide the victory and defeat of matches. But it is evident that some of the contentious and wrong decisions change the results of matches as well as the ranking of tournaments. Due to this reason, most of the sport's governing bodies use latest technology i.e. hawk-eye system, goal line technology and video technology system. The football is World famous game but yet it does not use any type of technology to review the decisions of referees. FIFA may not use such type of technology because of fear of losing the viewership due to interruption and delay in game. Keeping in view these facts, there is an urgent and contextual need to use the referral system in football game on experimental basis. The most controversial decisions in football are goal score, penalty awarding, caution given and offside judgements. At initial stage, goal score and penalty awarding may be considered in the review system. The captain of team may be authorised to call for referral system on goal score and penalty awarding only. The video official shall decide within one minute for the decision and only one chance shall be given to a team but if the appeal stands then they can go for another chance till a single chance is exhausted.","[Thandal, Jaspal Singh] Lyallpur Khalsa Coll, Dept Phys Educ & Sports, Jalandhar, Punjab, India; [Singh, Gobind] Guru Nanak Coll Moga, Phys Educ, Moga, Punjab, India",,"Thandal, JS (corresponding author), Lyallpur Khalsa Coll, Dept Phys Educ & Sports, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.",,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,3,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-094-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,181,183,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Sport Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sport Sciences,BH2JE,,,,,7/25/25,WOS:000398982800045,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a broader, more extensive framework for strategic analysis in general games, which we illustrate in the context of a particular social dilemma encountered in interdependent security settings. Our framework is fully quantitative and computational, allowing one to measure the quality of strategic alternatives across a series of measures, and as a function of relevant game parameters. Our special focus on performing analysis over a parametric landscape is motivated by public policy considerations, where possible interventions are modeled as affecting particular parameters of the game. Our findings qualify the touted efficacy of the Tit-for-Tat strategy, demonstrate the importance of monitoring, and exhibit a phase transition in cooperative behavior in response to a manipulation of policy-relevant parameters of the game.","[Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Kimbrough, Steven; Kunreuther, Howard] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Vanderbilt University; University of Pennsylvania,"Vorobeychik, Y (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",eug.vorobey@gmail.com,,"Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy/0000-0003-2471-5345",Climate Decision Making Center (CDMC) located in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy; NSF [SES-0345798]; Carnegie Mellon University; CREATE (National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events - U.S. Department of Homeland Security) [2007-ST-061-000001]; Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) [SES-0345840]; Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center; Sandia National Laboratories; U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration [DE-AC04-94AL85000],Climate Decision Making Center (CDMC) located in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Carnegie Mellon University; CREATE (National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events - U.S. Department of Homeland Security); Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED); Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center; Sandia National Laboratories(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration(National Nuclear Security Administration),"This work was supported in part by the Climate Decision Making Center (CDMC) located in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy (Cooperative Agreement between the NSF (SES-0345798) and Carnegie Mellon University), CREATE (National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, award number 2007-ST-061-000001), the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED; NSF Cooperative Agreement SES-0345840 to Columbia University), Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center, and Sandia National Laboratories.

This study uses arousal theory as a basis for exploring the influence mechanism of e-sports tourists' impulsive behavior in Chinese collective culture. A sample of 562 participants in China were surveyed online to test the research model, which included 10 hypotheses. The empirical results indicate that: Firstly, the system quality of the Information System (IS) success model and the human stimuli influence arousal; secondly, tourists' motivation for e-sports tourism, group honor concerns, and identity in the Chinese context also positively affect arousal, and then influence impulsive behavior; and thirdly, arousal has a mediating effect between the environmental stimuli (except in-formation quality) and impulsive behavior. This paper innovatively proposes that the physical and psychological elements of environmental stimuli could significantly affect arousal levels, thus in turn influencing impulsive behavior in e-sports tourism. Furthermore, the conclusion section discuses practical suggestions for the orga-nizers of e-sports tournaments, such as adjusting environmental stimuli to achieve optimal arousal levels.","[Zhang, Shan; Liu, Weifang; Han, Wei; Xie, Jiaming; Sun, Mengbo] Hainan Univ, Sch Touirsm, 58 Renmin Rd, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China",Hainan University,"Liu, WF (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Touirsm, 58 Renmin Rd, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China.",2638940612@qq.com,"; zhang, shan/MIQ-0163-2025; sun, mengbo/IYJ-6114-2023; Han, Wei/L-7391-2016","Zhang, Shan/0000-0002-3568-329X;",Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund [ZDYF2022SHFZ031]; National Natural Science Fund of China [41906176],Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund; National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the [Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund] under Grant [number ZDYF2022SHFZ031] ; [National Natural Science Fund of China] under Grant [number 41906176] .,,134,8,8,29,123,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-9736,2211-9744,,TOUR MANAG PERSPECT,Tour.

The incidence, severity (% time loss illness, days lost per illness) and burden of GITill with/without systemic symptoms and signs in professional South African male rugby players during the Super Rugby tournament (2013-2017) are reported.METHODS: Team physicians completed daily illness logs of players (N.=537; 1141 player-seasons, 102738 player-days). The incidence (ill-nesses/1000 player-days, 95% CI), severity (% >1-day time-loss; days until return-to-play [DRTP]/single illness [mean: 95% CI]) and illness burden (IB: days lost to illness/1000 player-days) for the subcategories of GITill with/without systemic symptoms and signs (GITill+ss; GITill-ss), and gastroenteritis with/without systemic symptoms and signs (GE+ss; GE-ss) are reported.RESULTS: The incidence of all GITill was 1.0 (0.8-1.2). Incidence was similar for GITill+ss 0.6 (0.4-0.8) and GITill-ss 0.4 (0.3-0.5; P=0.0603). Incidence of GE+ss 0.6 (0.4-0.7) was higher than GE-ss 0.3 (0.2-0.4; P=0.0045). GITill caused >1-day time-loss in 62% of cases (GE+ss 66.7%; GE-ss 53.6%). GITill caused an average of 1.1 DRTP/single GITill, which was similar for subcategories. IB of GITill+ss was higher than GITill-ss (IB Ratio: 2.1 [1.1-3.9; P=0.0253]). IB for GITill+ss is 2 times higher than GITill-ss (IB Ratio: 2.1 [1.1-3.9]; P=0.0253); and GE+ss >3 times higher than GE-ss (IB Ratio: 3.0 [1.6-5.8]; P=0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: GITill accounted for 21.9% of all illnesses during the Super Rugby tournament, with >60% of GITill resulting in time-loss. The average DRTP/single illness was 1.1.

Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an interventions tournament to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The winning intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslimsbut not other groups (White Americans, Christians)for individual group members' actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.","[Bruneau, Emile; Falk, Emily] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bruneau, Emile] Conflict Innovat Lab, Boston, MA USA; [Kteily, Nour] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Northwestern University,"Bruneau, E (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ebruneau@asc.upenn.edu,"Kteily, Nour/KGK-8931-2024",,,,,,44,41,46,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

Design: A cross-sectional observational study performed prospectively. This brief report examines the removal of head guards in 2 different ways. The first was to examine the stoppages due to blows to the head by comparing World Series Boxing (WSB), without head guards, to other AIBA competitions with head guards. Secondly, we examined the last 3 world championships: 2009 and 2011 (with head guards) and 2013 (without head guards). Setting: World Series Boxing and AIBA world championship boxing. Participants: Boxers from WSB and AIBA world championships. Interventions: The information was recorded by ringside medical physicians. Main Outcome Measures: Stoppages per 10 000 rounds; stoppages per 1000 hours. Results: Both studies show that the number of stoppages due to head blows was significantly decreased without head guards. The studies also showed that there was a notable increase in cuts.

However, current interventions remain poorly guided by evidence. Our objective was to quantify heading exposure in youth football, assessing the effects of sex and age. Football matches played during an international youth football tournament with no heading restrictions were directly observed, including players from both sexes (11-19 years). The elite senior level was included for comparison, using video analysis. All heading events were registered, classified, and assigned to individual players. Heading rates were calculated for each sex and age group. We observed a total of 267 matches, corresponding to 4011 player hours (1927 player hours for females, 2083 player hours for males). Males headed more frequently than females (2.7 vs 1.8 headers/player hour; P < .001). Heading rates increased with age (ANOVA, P < .001), approaching the elite senior level for players 16 years and older. There was substantial variation within teams for all age and sex groups, with the widest range (1-18 headers) observed for girls aged 19. Girls younger than 12 years had the lowest exposure, with an average of <2 players per team heading the ball, each with 1-2 headers. In conclusion, age and sex influence head impact exposure in youth football, and warrants careful consideration when introducing injury prevention measures. Males are more frequently exposed than females, heading rates increase with age, and there is substantial variation between players. Heading is a rare event in the youngest age groups, especially among females.","[Sandmo, Stian Bahr; Andersen, Thor Einar; Bahr, Roald] Norwegian Sch Sport Sci, Dept Sports Med, Oslo Sports Trauma Res Ctr, PB 4014 Ulleval Stad, NO-0806 Oslo, Norway; [Sandmo, Stian Bahr] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo, Norway; [Koerte, Inga Katharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychosomat & Ps, Munich, Germany; [Koerte, Inga Katharina] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Psychiat Neuroimaging Lab, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Norwegian School of Sport Sciences; University of Oslo; University of Munich; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School,"Sandmo, SB (corresponding author), Norwegian Sch Sport Sci, Dept Sports Med, Oslo Sports Trauma Res Ctr, PB 4014 Ulleval Stad, NO-0806 Oslo, Norway.",s.b.sandmo@nih.no,"; Bahr, Roald/B-6964-2014; Andersen, Thor Einar/LSJ-0737-2024; Koerte, Inga/AAW-3031-2021","Andersen, Thor Einar/0000-0003-4172-4518;",The Research Council of Norway Funding Source: Medline; ERA-NET NEURON Funding Source: Medline; The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research Funding Source: Medline,The Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); ERA-NET NEURON; The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,,,26,41,42,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7188,1600-0838,,SCAND J MED SCI SPOR,Scand.

A laboratory experiment,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Affirmative action; Competition; Multi-stage tournament; Gender gap; Laboratory experiments,GENDER-DIFFERENCES; AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION; POWER CALCULATIONS; GRANT APPLICATIONS; COMPETITIVENESS; RELIABILITY; GAP,"Women are less likely to enroll in selective or scientific courses, applying for promotions and are particularly underrepresented in both middle and top positions in the STEM field. Quota are often advocated as an instrument to reduce this gender gap, but it remains unclear at what step of the career ladder they more effectively foster women's reaching the top. Many factors may affect quota's success or failure, such as how they would in turn affect teamwork and trust between members within organizations or coordination in applying for promotions. In this paper, by means of a laboratory experiment implementing a two-stage tournament, we evaluate the impact of three different interventions in affecting individual decision to climb the career ladder, abstracting away from other possible confounding factors. We find that, compared with no intervention, a gender quota introduced in the initial stage of competition was ineffective in encouraging women to compete for the top; quotas introduced in the final stage of competition or at both stages increased women's willingness to compete for the top, without distorting the performance of the winners.

Social experience was defined as a rearing condition allowing visual, tactile, chemosensory, and auditory contact with zero, three, or 15 additional conspecifics. Behaviors were videotaped once weekly from 3 weeks to 4 months post-hatching, using the focal animal method, and an ethogram was constructed. At 3 months post-hatching, half the fish were injected once with testosterone propionate (2-mu-g/g b.w., i.p., vehicle-Ringer's solution) and the other half were injected with Ringer's isotonic saline solution. Testosterone-treated subjects showed significantly greater frequencies and durations of behaviors that may be related to aggression than did saline controls. Two weeks after the treatments, a round-robin tournament was conducted between testosterone- and saline-treated fish from each rearing condition. Testosterone-treated fish won significantly more encounters than did saline-treated subjects over all rearing conditions. Furthermore, significantly more aggressive acts were displayed by fish raised in the groups of 16 and the groups of four than did the Isolates. Although the number of aggressive acts exhibited by the group of 16 was greater than the group of four, the difference was not statistically significant.","UNIV S FLORIDA,NEW COLL,DIV NAT SCI,5700 N TAMIAMI TRAIL,SAROSOTA,FL 34243",State University System of Florida; New College Florida; University of South Florida,,,,,,,,,25,10,12,0,8,WILEY-LISS,NEW YORK,"DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012",0096-140X,,,AGGRESSIVE BEHAV,Aggressive Behav.,,1991,17,4,,,,,229,239,,10.1002/1098-2337(1991)17:4<229::AID-AB2480170406>3.0.CO;2-M,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1098-2337(1991)17:4<229::AID-AB2480170406>3.0.CO;2-M,,,11,"Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Psychology,FU130,,,,,7/25/25,WOS:A1991FU13000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

SFH projects attempt to contribute to the development of healthy lifestyle behavior and physically active societies through sport-related programs and interventions. The purpose of this paper was to explore the socio-managerial challenges and opportunities of a netball -based SFH program in Tonga. Based on local focus group and interview data, findings were grouped under five overarching themes: strategic management of volunteer network, sociocultural barriers, public space management, events and tournaments as incentives, and collaboration across local and national sports. In discussing these findings in context, we provide implications for managing culturally sensitive SFH projects in the Pacific region and beyond.

Typically, different scientists test different intervention ideas in different samples using different outcomes over different time intervals(2). The lack of comparability of such individual investigations limits their potential to inform policy. Here, to address this limitation and accelerate the pace of discovery, we introduce the megastudy-a massive field experiment in which the effects of many different interventions are compared in the same population on the same objectively measured outcome for the same duration. In a megastudy targeting physical exercise among 61,293 members of an American fitness chain, 30 scientists from 15 different US universities worked in small independent teams to design a total of 54 different four-week digital programmes (or interventions) encouraging exercise. We show that 45% of these interventions significantly increased weekly gym visits by 9% to 27%; the top-performing intervention offered microrewards for returning to the gym after a missed workout. Only 8% of interventions induced behaviour change that was significant and measurable after the four-week intervention. Conditioning on the 45% of interventions that increased exercise during the intervention, we detected carry-over effects that were proportionally similar to those measured in previous research(3-6). Forecasts by impartial judges failed to predict which interventions would be most effective, underscoring the value of testing many ideas at once and, therefore, the potential for megastudies to improve the evidentiary value of behavioural science.","[Milkman, Katherine L.;

The incidence of stoppage time due to incidents and the resulting injury characteristics of professional football players, participating in the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup (MWC) in Russia and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup (WWC) in France were examined retrospectively through video analysis. In the 2018 MWC, a total of 123 injury time-outs with 132 treatments occurred in 64 matches, while in the 2019 WWC, 142 incidents with 150 injured players were recorded in 52 matches. The incidence of stoppage time was higher in women than in men (81.2 vs. 56.8 per 1000 match hours, respectively, p=0.004), and accordingly, women had a higher overall incidence of Injury (IRR 1.4 (95%CI= 1.1-1.8), p=0.005). Despite women required more medical care during games, the substitution rate after the incidents was higher for men (27.3% to 15.3%, p=0.02). Almost three-quarters of Incidents for both sexes were sudden-onset contact injuries and the most common site was the lower limb. Although more frequent match incidents were seen in women's football, the rate of completing the game without being substituted was higher than that of men.

There needs to be more evidence-based research for interventions for vaccine hesitancy. Existing effectiveness evaluations are limited to one particular hypothesis, and no studies have compared the effectiveness of different interventions. A megastudy takes a large-scale, multi-intervention, uniform participant and the same evaluation criteria approach to evaluate many interventions simultaneously and find the most effective ones.

Additionally, considering the complex causes of vaccine hesitancy, we design interventions that involve social factors in megastudies.

In this article, we use design contests allowing repeated entry to examine the effect of in-process feedback on idea generation. We report on a set of field experiments using two online contest websites to compare the performance of three different feedback treatmentsno feedback, random feedback, and directed feedback (i.e., in-process feedback highly correlated with the final quality rating of the entry). We posted six logo design contests for consumer products and accepted submissions for 1week. We provided daily feedback during the contest period using one of the three treatments. We then used a panel of target consumers to rate the quality of each idea. We find that directed feedback is associated positively with agent participation. For outcome, while directed feedback benefits the average quality of entries submitted, we don't find that relationship for the best entriesindeed, no feedback or random feedback may produce better top-end entry quality. We also find that, under directed feedback, the variance in quality declines as the contest progresses.","[Wooten, Joel O.] Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Ulrich, Karl T.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Pennsylvania,"Wooten, JO (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",joel.wooten@moore.sc.edu; ulrich@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Mack Center for Technological Innovation at The Wharton School,Mack Center for Technological Innovation at The Wharton School,The Mack Center for Technological Innovation at The Wharton School provided financial support for this research.

Integrated school nutrition interventions offer promising pathways towards improving adolescent nutrition status, food security and building sustainable skill sets. Methods and analysis The Meals, Education, and Gardens for In-School Adolescents (MEGA) project aims to implement and evaluate an integrated, school-based nutrition intervention package among secondary schools in the Chamwino District of Dodoma, Tanzania. MEGA is a cluster-randomised controlled trial, including six public secondary schools assigned to three different arms. Two schools will receive the full intervention package, including school meals, school gardens, nutrition education and community workshops. Two schools will receive the partial intervention package, including the school garden, nutrition education and community workshops. Two schools will serve as the controls and will not receive any intervention. The intervention will be implemented for one academic year. Baseline and end-line quantitative data collection will include 750 adolescents and 750 parents. The domains of outcomes for adolescents will include haemoglobin concentrations, anthropometry, educational outcomes and knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding nutrition, agriculture and health. The domains of outcomes for parents will include knowledge, attitudes and practices of nutrition, agriculture and health. End-line focus group discussions will be conducted among selected adolescents, parents and teachers to assess the facilitators and barriers associated with the intervention.

Twenty-two elite under-17 female football players participated in this randomized controlled trial, which encompassed fourteen 90 min official matches. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three recovery protocols: passive stretching, foam rolling, or lumbopelvic mobility exercises, which were implemented ten minutes after each match. Countermovement jump with free arm (CMJA) height was measured pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 5 h post-intervention. Wellness perception was evaluated 24 h later. Significant enhancements in CMJA height were observed immediately after all recovery protocols and at 5 h post-intervention compared with pre-intervention (p < 0.001). The lumbopelvic mobility protocol yielded the most substantial improvement, significantly surpassing both stretching and foam rolling. Moreover, significant increases in wellness perception were observed following the foam rolling (p < 0.001, ES = 0.95) and mobility (p < 0.05, ES = 0.88) protocols, with the mobility protocol demonstrating a marginally larger effect size than stretching. Active recovery strategies significantly enhanced neuromuscular function and wellness perception in under-17 female soccer players. Lumbopelvic mobility exercises exhibited superior efficacy, suggesting that they should be prioritized in post-match recovery regimens.","[Sedano, Silvia; Maroto-Izquierdo, Sergio] European Univ Miguel De Cervantes, Dept Hlth Sci, Valladolid 47012, Spain; [Maroto-Izquierdo, Sergio] European Univ Miguel de Cervantes, Dept Hlth Sci, iHeALTH Strateg Res Grp, Valladolid 47012, Spain; [Maroto-Izquierdo, Sergio] Proporc A, Appl Sports Sci Ctr, Valladolid 47015, Spain",Miguel de Cervantes European University (UEMC); Miguel de Cervantes European University (UEMC),"Sedano, S (corresponding author), European Univ Miguel De Cervantes, Dept Hlth Sci, Valladolid 47012, Spain.",ssedano@uemc.es; smaroto@uemc.es,"Maroto-Izquierdo, Sergio/KHT-5731-2024",,,,,,50,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4663,,SPORTS,Sports,FEB,2025,13,2,,,,,,,36,10.3390/sports13020036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sports13020036,,,10,Sport Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sport Sciences,Y5F5M,39997967,gold,,,7/25/25,WOS:001432380100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A meta-analysis of the experimental literature,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competitiveness; Gender; Experiments; Meta-analysis,WOMEN SHY; RISK; PREFERENCES; MATRILINEAL; ATTITUDES; TOO,"This paper systematizes the experimental evidence on gender differences in competition preferences with a meta-analysis of 110 studies and 409 effect sizes on observed or residual gender gaps in experimental tournament entry. Our meta-summary confirms that, across all studies, men choose a tournament scheme 13 percentage points more often than women, which is only about a third of the gap found in Niederle and Vesterlund's (2007) seminal paper. Our meta-regression analysis reveals that larger gender differences are indeed prevalent in studies that most closely apply the Niederle-Vesterlund design, i.e., differences are largest in lab experiments with student subject pools and when math tasks are involved, but almost negligible for other age groups, verbal tasks, and in field-like environments. Experimental interventions such as information treatments or affirmative action measures prove very effective in reducing or even eliminating the gender gap. Although some measures of risk preferences and confidence are systematically related to the estimated residual gender gap in tournament entry, they do not eradicate competitiveness as a distinct trait. Finally, higher gender equality at the country level seems to go along with larger differences in women's and men's competition preferences. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ex ante honesty oaths-commitments to honesty before action-have been proposed as interventions to counteract dishonest behaviour, but the heterogeneity in findings across operationalizations calls their effectiveness into question. We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)-proposed, evaluated and selected by 44 expert researchers-and a no-oath condition in a megastudy involving 21,506 UK and US participants from Prolific.com who played an incentivized tax evasion game online. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, though experts' predictions were more accurate. In conclusion, honesty oaths were effective in curbing dishonesty, but their effectiveness varied depending on content. These findings can help design impactful interventions to curb dishonesty.","[Zickfeld, Janis H.; Elbaek, Christian T.; Tonnesen, Mathilde H.; Mitkidis, Panagiotis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, Aarhus, Denmark;

In addition to standard lexical variables (such as word frequency, length, and orthographic and phonological neighborhood), we have also developed new measures of past tense neighborhood consistency and verb imageability for these stimuli, and via regression analyses we demonstrate the utility of these new measures in predicting past tense verb generation. The PTIP can be used to further evaluate existing models, to provide well controlled stimuli for new studies, and to uncover novel theoretical principles in past tense morphology.","[Cohen-Shikora, Emily R.; Balota, David A.; Kapuria, Abhi] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Yap, Melvin J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Psychol, Singapore 117548, Singapore",Washington University (WUSTL); National University of Singapore,"Cohen-Shikora, ER (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",ecohensh@wustl.edu,"; Yap, Melvin/E-8264-2016","Cohen-Shikora, Emily/0000-0002-4555-3130; Yap, Melvin/0000-0002-5372-4323;",NIA NIH HHS [T32 AG00030] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,40,7,8,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1554-351X,1554-3528,,BEHAV RES METHODS,Behav.

Linguistic characteristics that influence the processing of real English words - namely, phonotactic probability, phonological neighbourhood density, uniqueness point, and morphological complexity - were also found to influence the processing time of spoken pseudowords. Subsequently, we analysed how the linguistic characteristics of non-unique portions of pseudowords influenced processing time. We again found that the named linguistic characteristics affected processing time, highlighting the dynamicity of activation and competition. We argue these findings also speak to learning new words and spoken word recognition generally. We then discuss what aspects of pseudoword recognition a full model of spoken word recognition must account for. We finish with a re-description of the auditory lexical decision task in light of our results.","[Kelley, Matthew C.; Tucker, Benjamin V.] Univ Alberta, Dept Linguist, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E7, Canada; [Kelley, Matthew C.] Univ Washington, Dept Linguist, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Alberta; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kelley, MC (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Linguist, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E7, Canada.;Kelley, MC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Linguist, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mattck@uw.edu,"; Tucker, Benjamin/KPA-7567-2024; Kelley, Matthew/IYT-1147-2023","Tucker, Benjamin/0000-0001-8965-7890; Kelley, Matthew C./0000-0002-7218-5599",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-0678],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This project was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 435-2014-0678].,,98,1,1,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2327-3798,2327-3801,,LANG COGN NEUROSCI,Lang.

In 2016 the US Preventive Services Task Force released guidelines recommending universal screening in primary care to identify patients with depression and to link them to treatment. Feasible, acceptable, and effective strategies to implement these guidelines are needed. Methods This three-phased study employed rapid participatory methods to design and test strategies to increase depression screening at Penn Medicine, a large health system with 90 primary care practices. First, researchers solicited ideas and barriers from stakeholders to increase screening using an innovation tournament-a crowdsourcing method that invites stakeholders to submit ideas to address a workplace challenge. Second, a panel of stakeholders and scientists deliberated over and ranked the tournament ideas. An instant runoff election was held to select the winning idea. Third, the research team piloted the winning idea in a primary care practice using rapid prototyping, an approach that quickly refines and iterates strategy designs. Results The innovation tournament yielded 31 ideas and 32 barriers from diverse stakeholders (12 primary care physicians, 10 medical assistants, 4 nurse practitioners, 2 practice managers, and 4 patient support assistants). A panel of 6 stakeholders and scientists deliberated on the ideas and voted for patient self-report (i.e., through tablet computers, text message, or an online patient portal) as the winning idea. The research team rapid prototyped tablets in one primary care practice with one physician over 5 five-hour shifts to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the strategy. Most patients, the physician, and medical assistants found the tablets acceptable and feasible. However, patient support assistants struggled to incorporate them in their workflow and expressed concerns about scaling up the process. Depression screening rates were higher using tablets compared to usual care; follow-up was comparable between tablets and usual care. Conclusions Rapid participatory methods engaged and amplified the voices of diverse stakeholders in primary care. These methods helped design an acceptable and feasible implementation strategy that showed promise for increasing depression screening in a primary care setting. The next step is to evaluate the strategy in a randomized controlled trial across primary care practices.","[Last, Briana S.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 3815 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Buttenheim, Alison M.] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Dept Family & Community Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Buttenheim, Alison M.; Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Ctr Hlth Incent & Behav Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Buttenheim, Alison M.; Stewart, Rebecca E.; Press, Matthew J.; Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Futterer, Anne C.; Livesey, Cecilia; Stewart, Rebecca E.; Reilly, Megan; Wolk, Courtney Benjamin; Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jaeger, Jeffrey; Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Press, Matthew J.; Peifer, Maryanne] Univ Penn, Primary Care Serv Line, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Peifer, Maryanne] Univ Penn, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wolk, Courtney Benjamin; Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ PISCE LDI, Penn Implementat Sci Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Beidas, Rinad S.] Univ Penn Hlth Syst, Penn Med Nudge Unit, Philadelphia, PA USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Last, BS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 3815 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",brishiri@sas.upenn.edu,"Beidas, Rinad/ABG-2094-2021; Last, Briana/GYD-5057-2022","Last, Briana/0000-0002-5473-1357; Beidas, Rinad/0000-0001-6056-6071;",National Institute of Mental Health [P50 MH 113840]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1321851],National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding for this study was provided by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (P50 MH 113840, Beidas, Buttenheim, Mandell, MPI).

J,"Barrie, PJ",,,,"Barrie, PJ",,,A new sports ratings system: the tiddlywinks world ratings,JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A system for calculating relative playing strengths of tiddlywinks players is described. The method can also be used for other sports. It is specifically designed to handle cases where the number of games played in a season varies greatly between players, and thus the confidence that one can have in an assigned rating also varies greatly between players. In addition, the method is designed to handle situations in which some games in the tournament are played as individuals (singles), while others are played with a partner ('pairs'). These factors make application of some statistical treatments, such as the Elo rating system used in chess, difficult to apply. The new method characterizes each player's ability by a numerical rating together with an associated uncertainty in that player's rating. After each tournament, a 'tournament rating' is calculated for each player based on how many points the player achieved and the relative strength of partner(s) and opponent(s). Statistical analysis is then used to estimate the likely error in the calculated tournament rating. Both the tournament rating and its estimated error are used in the calculation of new ratings. The method has been applied to calculate tiddlywinks world ratings based on over 13000 national tournament games in Britain and the USA going back to 1985.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England",University of Cambridge,"Barrie, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn, Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England.",,,"Barrie, Patrick/0000-0002-6241-399X",,,,,4,0,0,0,5,CARFAX PUBLISHING,BASINGSTOKE,"RANKINE RD, BASINGSTOKE RG24 8PR, HANTS, ENGLAND",0266-4763,,,J APPL STAT,J.

In a laboratory experiment, we randomly assign subjects the role of either principal or agent. The principal decides whether the agent performs a real-effort task under piece-rate or tournament incentives. When deciding, the principal is informed about the agent's previous performance, age, and residency. Between treatments, we vary whether the principal knows the agent's gender. In a baseline treatment, we replicate the standard setting in which subjects decide for themselves whether to compete. Our main findings are, first, that there is no gender gap in tournament entry when principals decide for agents as opposed to the baseline treatment. Second, the gender gap closes because more women are made to compete by principals. Third, whereas there is no gender gap in either of the principal treatments, revealing the agent's gender is associated with higher overall tournament entry rates. Exploratory analyses of principals' choice determinants reveal a positive effect of preferences to take risks, competitiveness, and confidence in agents' performances on making agents compete. In addition, we find no difference in how principals evaluate male and female agents' performances. Finally, we test the efficiency of principals' competition choices and show that they lead to fewer payoff-maximizing outcomes than when subjects decide for themselves. Additionally, overall tournament performances and winners' performances are lower when agents are made to compete, but this effect is not robust to controlling for agents' previous performances.","[Fornwagner, Helena] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Fornwagner, Helena] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Pompeo, Monika] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Serdarevic, Nina] Ctr Appl Res, FAIR Insight Team, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",University of Regensburg; University of Exeter; University of Bologna,"Fornwagner, H (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.;Fornwagner, H (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",helena.fornwagner@ur.de; monika.pompeo@unibo.it; nina.serdarevic@snf.no,"; Fornwagner, Helena/KCY-5480-2024","Fornwagner, Helena/0000-0001-9932-6139;",L.

Innovation tournaments, a structured participatory design strategy to crowdsource ideas, are a promising approach to participatory design that may increase the effectiveness of implementation strategies by involving end users (i.e., clinicians). We utilized a system-wide innovation tournament to garner ideas from clinicians about how to enhance the use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) within a large public behavioral health system.MethodsOur innovation tournament occurred in three phases. First, we invited over 500 clinicians to share, through a web-based platform, their ideas regarding how their organizations could best support use of EBPs. Clinicians could rate and comment on ideas submitted by others. Second, submissions were judged by an expert panel (including behavioral scientists, system leaders, and payers) based on their rated enthusiasm for the idea. Third, we held a community-facing event during which the six clinicians who submitted winning ideas presented their strategies to 85 attendees representing a cross-section of clinicians and system and organizational leaders.ResultsWe had a high rate of participation (12.3%), more than double the average rate of previous tournaments conducted in other settings (5%). A total of 65 ideas were submitted by 55 participants representing 38 organizations. The most common categories of ideas pertained to training (42%), financing and compensation (26%), clinician support and preparation tools (22%), and EBP-focused supervision (17%). The expert panel and clinicians differed on their ratings of the ideas, highlighting value of seeking input from multiple stakeholder groups when developing implementation strategies.ConclusionsInnovation tournaments are a useful and feasible methodology for engaging end users, system leaders, and behavioral scientists through a structured approach to developing implementation strategies. The process and resultant strategies engendered significant enthusiasm and engagement from participants at all levels of a healthcare system. Research is needed to compare the effectiveness of strategies developed through innovation tournaments to strategies developed through design approaches.","[Stewart, Rebecca E.; Byeon, Y.

A combined total of 440 participants completed eye-tracking experiments in which they silently read unspaced English compound words (e.g.,goalpost) embedded in sentence contexts (e.g.,Dylan hit the goalpost when he was aiming for the net.). Three studies were conducted using participants representing the non-college-bound population (300 participants), and four studies included participants recruited from the student population (140 participants). The database comprises trial-level eye-movement data (47,763 trials), participant data (including a measure of reading experience estimated via the Author Recognition Test), and lexical characteristics for the set of 931 English compound words used as critical stimuli in the studies. One contribution of the present paper is a set of regression analyses conducted on the full database and individual experiments. We report that the most reliable and consistent main effects were those elicited by compound word length, left constituent frequency, right constituent frequency, compound frequency and semantic transparency. Separately, we also found that the effect of left frequency and compound word length is weaker among more frequent compounds. Another contribution is a power analysis, in which we determined the sample sizes required to reliably detect effect sizes that are comparable to those observed in our regression models. These sample size estimates serve as a recommendation for researchers wishing to either collect eye-movement data for compound word reading, or use the current database as a resource for the study of English compound word processing.","[Schmidtke, Daniel; Kuperman, Victor] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Van Dyke, Julie A.] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT USA",McMaster University; Yale University; Haskins Laboratories,"Schmidtke, D (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",schmiddf@mcmaster.ca,"Van Dyke, Julie/I-4767-2017; VanDyke, Julie/I-4767-2017","Van Dyke, Julie/0000-0002-5542-018X; Schmidtke, Daniel/0000-0002-6518-9778","Ontario Trillium Award; Lewis & Ruth Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship (McMaster University); Canadian NSERC [RGPIN/402395-2012 415]; Ontario Early Researcher award; Canada Research Chair (Tier 2); SSHRC Partnership Training Grant [895-2016-1008]; FI Leaders Opportunity Fund; NIH [R01 HD-073288, P01 HD-01994]","Ontario Trillium Award; Lewis & Ruth Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship (McMaster University); Canadian NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario Early Researcher award(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Canada Research Chair (Tier 2)(Canada Research Chairs); SSHRC Partnership Training Grant(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); FI Leaders Opportunity Fund; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","Daniel Schmidtke, McMaster English Language Development Diploma (MELD) program, Department of Linguistics and Language, McMaster University; Julie A.

Three community centers located in upstate New York provided group participants (N = 210) known to have conduct disorder and substance abuse history. The centers were used as the intervention sites over a seven-week period with the youth assessment staff using objective screening measures. The participants were exposed to a two-pronged intervention, using a parental involvement cohort with approximately half of the study participants. The Teams, Games, and Tournaments strategy was the intervention method. Teams, Games, and Tournaments is a Social Learning Theory-based intervention with demonstrated empirical evidence of the model's effectiveness. A 2 x 3 factorial design with two follow-up points encompassed: anger control, alcohol/substance abuse, and family interactive education. The goals of the study were to help adolescents reduce their alcohol use, to increase productive family interaction, and ultimately to reduce the adolescents' aggression levels and subsequently reduce the possibility of their becoming victims or perpetrators of a violent crime. Consistent with Social Learning Theory, the Teams, Games, and Tournaments treatment intervention makes use of adolescents as peer counselors. The practical implications include that professionals or students in our public schools, juvenile courts, correctional institutions, and residential treatment centers can easily implement this program. A standardized treatment manual is available. It offers a complete, ready-to-use, and cost-effective tool for reducing adolescent violence and alcohol abuse. Further, the data provide support for a hypothesis of social learning theory, that is: interventions using multiple components are more effective than single treatments on their own.","[Wodarski, John S.] Univ Tennessee, Coll Social Work, 324 Henson Hall,1618 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Wodarski, JS (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Coll Social Work, 324 Henson Hall,1618 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",jwodarsk@utk.edu,,,Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,Preparation of this manuscript was supported by funding from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.,,65,4,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2376-1407,2376-1415,,J EVID-INFORM SOC WO,J.

Integrating these broad themes, we develop a model expanding the breadth of relevant social context variables to include horizontal pay dispersion. Building from tournament theory, in a field experiment of 267 employees across 22 units, we find improved performance from diagnostic feedback delivered under increasing pay dispersion; however, substantively different patterns emerge for criterion-referenced feedback.

Design & setting: Using a within-within group design with repeated measures, the study recorded data on physiological and physical variables before, immediately after, and at 10- and 15-min post-match, including blood lactate, sprinting ability, explosive strength, and agility. Participants: Twenty-one male basketball players, aged 18-25 years, were purposively selected from Haridwar district, Uttarakhand. All participants had prior competitive experience, having competed in either the INBL or Red Bull Half Court Tournament. Results: Post-match lactate levels averaged 10.0 mmol/L, dropping to 4.4 mmol/L by 15-min. Active recovery combined with foam rolling improved lactate clearance and performance metrics more effectively than active recovery alone or with massage therapy, which showed better explosive strength recovery but less efficient lactate clearance. Conclusion: Active recovery with foam rolling was more effective for immediate lactate clearance and agility compared to active recovery with massage therapy, highlighting the need for personalized recovery strategies due to individual variability in responses.","[Maan, Kamal Singh; Yadav, Ramesh Chand] Lakshmibai Natl Inst Phys Educ, Dept Exercise Physiol, NERC, Gauhati 782402, Assam, India",,"Maan, KS (corresponding author), Lakshmibai Natl Inst Phys Educ, Dept Exercise Physiol, NERC, Gauhati 782402, Assam, India.",ksmaan.sports@nitrr.ac.in,,", Kamal Singh Maan/0009-0000-3168-4546",,,,,29,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1360-8592,1532-9283,,J BODYW MOV THER,J.

Relief of barotrauma symptoms is necessary to reduce mortality, but we currently know little about sublethal effects associated with relief methods. Here, we assess the condition and behavior of tournament-caught Walleye Sander vitreus with barotrauma by using three popular relief methods: 1) swim bladder venting, 2) deep-water release (descending), and 3) livewell reorientation with fin weights. In a short-term ex situ experiment, 50% of untreated fish with barotrauma did not recover sufficiently to be released after 20 h. Fin weighting immediately improved condition by enabling fish to regain correct orientation; however, only 53% of fin-weighted fish recovered sufficiently to be released. All vented fish were negatively buoyant, but 73% were releasable after the holding period. In a concurrent in situ study, acoustic telemetry showed that Walleye without barotrauma (controls) made variable postrelease movements (total distance: 5.1-27.6 km), descended fish behaved similarly to controls (4.7-28.6 km), and vented fish made the shortest movements (2.6-16.7 km). However, there were no statistically significant differences in distance metrics among groups. Control and descended fish used larger areas and volumes of the lake than vented fish. Descended fish also used significantly deeper depths than vented fish, and control fish were intermediate in the depth used. Telemetry did not indicate mortality of any fish in the in situ study. Our data suggest that without treatment, mortality of Walleye with barotrauma could be as high as 50%. Fin weighting is not an effective catch-and-release aid for Walleye with moderate-to-severe barotrauma, and swim bladder venting may alter short-term, postrelease movements and habitat use. The consequences of these short-term changes to Walleye behavior from a fisheries management perspective are unclear. Eliminating catch-and-release angling in deep water is the best means of managing barotrauma in Walleye. If deep-water angling cannot be avoided, we recommend noninvasive descending over venting.","[Eberts, Rebecca L.; Zak, Megan A.; Manzon, Richard G.; Somers, Christopher M.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina,"Somers, CM (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",chris.somers@uregina.ca,"Somers, Christopher/AAE-6390-2019",,Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment's Fish & Wildlife Development Fund; Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation; Regina Fish Game League; Saskatchewan Walleye Trail; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs Program; University of Regina,Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment's Fish & Wildlife Development Fund; Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation; Regina Fish Game League; Saskatchewan Walleye Trail; Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs); University of Regina,"This research was supported by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment's Fish & Wildlife Development Fund, Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation, Regina Fish & Game League, Saskatchewan Walleye Trail, Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canada Research Chairs Program, and the University of Regina.

For instance, the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) provides researchers with access to naming and lexical-decision latencies for over 40,000 words. In the present work, we extended the megastudy approach to a task that emphasizes semantic processing. Using a concrete/abstract semantic decision (i.e., does the word refer to something concrete or abstract?), we collected decision latencies and accuracy rates for 10,000 English words. The stimuli were concrete and abstract words selected from Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kuperman's (2013) comprehensive list of concreteness ratings. In total, 321 participants provided responses to 1,000 words each. Whereas semantic effects tend to be quite modest in naming and lexical decision studies, analyses of the concrete/abstract semantic decision responses show that a substantial proportion of variance can be explained by semantic variables. The item-level and trial-level data will be useful for other researchers interested in the semantic processing of concrete and abstract words.","[Pexman, Penny M.; Heard, Alison; Lloyd, Ellen] Univ Calgary, Dept Psychol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Yap, Melvin J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",University of Calgary; National University of Singapore,"Pexman, PM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Psychol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",pexman@ucalgary.ca,"Yap, Melvin/E-8264-2016","Yap, Melvin/0000-0002-5372-4323; Pexman, Penny/0000-0001-7130-0973; Lloyd, Ellen/0000-0001-8541-2001",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada to P.M.P.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants comprised 124 players from two high schools who competed in national tournament soccer games held from April 2018 to March 2019. Players were randomly divided into intervention (with a 12-week stretching intervention by physical therapists) and control groups (without the intervention). Players and coaches provided written information regarding injuries and daily training and match times; physical therapists visited each team weekly to collect data and review documentation. Muscle tightness and injury incidence, number, type, location, circumstances, situations, severity, and contents during the 12-week intervention period and a subsequent 40-week observation period were compared between groups. Injuries were significantly lower with intervention during the 40-week observation period (P < .01) but not during the 12-week intervention period (P = .44). Injury types mainly included disorder, non-contact, lower-limb/trunk, and muscle/tendon injuries. Significant interactions were observed for all tightness-test measurement items. The intervention group showed significant improvements in heel-buttock distance, and straight leg-raise and hip rotation angles (pre-intervention < 12 weeks < 52 weeks), as well as significant improvements in ankle dorsiflexion angles at 12 and 52 weeks (relative to pre-intervention values). Instructed stretching exercises, personally designed by physical therapists to address muscle tightness, improved the range of motion and trunk flexibility, with a positive effect on the injury rate in male high school soccer players, especially for non-contact disorder injuries during training.","[Azuma, Nobuhide] Fukui Hlth Sci Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Rehabil Phys Therapy, 55 Egami Cho 13-1, Fukui, Fukui 9103190, Japan; [Azuma, Nobuhide] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Div Hlth Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Someya, Fujiko] Kanazawa Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan",Kanazawa University; Kanazawa University,"Azuma, N (corresponding author), Fukui Hlth Sci Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Rehabil Phys Therapy, 55 Egami Cho 13-1, Fukui, Fukui 9103190, Japan.",n-azuma@fukui-hsu.ac.jp,"Someya, Fujiko/H-7649-2013",,,,,,37,13,14,6,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7188,1600-0838,,SCAND J MED SCI SPOR,Scand.

Subjective (sleep, energy, and muscle soreness ratings) and objective (heart rate [HR] at rest [HRREST] and in response to submaximal exercise [HREX]) measures were obtained from 16 male rugby 7s players from 1 team for 3 consecutive days (D1-3) at home (HOME) and on arrival at 4 tournament (T1-4) locations (T1-New Zealand; T2-USA; T3-Hong Kong; and T4-Tokyo) across 2 WRSS competitions (2 tournaments per competition) separated by 1 month. At a group level, energy ratings were significantly lower in T2 and T4 compared with HOME, and on D1 T2 compared with D1 T1 (p <= 0.05). Greatest variability in subjective ratings was observed during T1 and T3 at an individual level, particularly for sleep quality. Although at a group level HRREST and HREX significantly decreased in T1-4 compared with HOME (p <= 0.05), there was only a similar to 50% agreement between the direction of change in HR indices at an individual level. Results from this study suggest that relocation between tournaments within WRSS competitions disrupts player preparedness measures to the largest degree. Hence, this period could be targeted by practitioners with appropriate recovery and/or sleep-promoting interventions or modulation of match-/training-load. Moreover, subjective rather than objective measures seem to be of greater use to inform player preparedness decision making, particularly at an individual level compared with a group level.","[Fowler, Peter M.; Farooq, Abdulaziz; Taylor, Lee] ASPETAR Orthopaed & Sports, Hosp Med, Athlete Hlth & Performance Res Ctr, Doha, Qatar; [Lumley, Nick] Scottish Rugby Union, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Murray, Andrew] Univ Oregon, Athlet Dept, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Taylor, Lee] Loughborough Univ, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England",Aspetar Orthopaedic & Sports Medicine Hospital; University of Oregon; Loughborough University,"Fowler, PM (corresponding author), ASPETAR Orthopaed & Sports, Hosp Med, Athlete Hlth & Performance Res Ctr, Doha, Qatar.",peter.fowler@aspetar.com,"; Farooq, Abdulaziz/D-8061-2015; Murray, Andrew/AAR-5403-2021","Taylor, Lee/0000-0002-8483-7187; Murray, Andrew/0000-0001-5014-1096;",,,,,40,5,6,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1064-8011,1533-4287,,J STRENGTH COND RES,J.

Methods: A total of 17 international male rugby sevens players participated in this study. Actigraphic and subjective sleep assessments were performed daily during 2 separate Sevens World Series competition legs (Oceania and America). The duration of each competition leg was subdivided into key periods (pretour, precompetition, tournament 1, relocation, tournament 2, and posttour) lasting 2 to 7 nights. Linear mixed models in combination with magnitude-based decisions were used to assess (1) the difference between preseason and key periods and (2) the effect of travel direction (eastward or westward). Results: Shorter total sleep time (hours:minutes) was observed during tournament 2 (mean [SD], 06:16 [01:08]), relocation (06:09 [01:09]), and the pretour week (06:34 [01:24]) compared with the preseason (06:52 [01:00]). Worse sleep quality (arbitrary units) was observed during tournament 1 (6.1 [2.0]) and 2 (5.7 [1.2]), as well as during the relocation week (6.3 [1.5]) than during the preseason (6.5 [1.8]). When traveling eastward compared with westward, earlier fall-asleep time was observed during tournament 1 (ES - 0.57; 90% CI, -1.12 to -0.01), the relocation week (-0.70 [-1.11 to -0.28]), and the posttour (-0.57 [-0.95 to -0.18]). However, possibly trivial and unclear differences were observed during the precompetition week (0.15 [-0.15 to 0.45]) and tournament 2 (0.81 [-0.29 to 1.91]). Conclusion: The sleep patterns of elite rugby sevens players are robust to the effects of long-haul travel and jet lag. However, the staff should consider promoting sleep during the tournament and relocation week.","[Leduc, Cedric; Tee, Jason C.; Jones, Ben] Leeds Beckett Univ, Carnegie Appl Rugby Res CARR Ctr, Carnegie Sch Sport, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Leduc, Cedric; Robineau, Julien; Cheradame, Jeremy; Piscione, Julien] French Rugby Federat FFR, Res Dept, Marcoussis, France; [Jones, Ben] Leeds Rhinos Rugby League Club, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Ben] Rugby Football League, England Performance Unit, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Ben] Univ New England, Sch Sci & Technol, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Jones, Ben] Univ Cape Town, Div Exercise Sci & Sports Med, Dept Human Biol, Fac Hlth Sci,Sports Sci Inst South Africa, Cape Town, South Africa; [Lacome, Mathieu] Paris St Germain FC, Performance Dept, St Germain En Laye, France; [Lacome, Mathieu] French Natl Inst Sport INSEP, Lab Sport Expertise & Performance EA 7370, Paris, France; [Tee, Jason C.] Durban Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Sport Studies, Durban, South Africa",Leeds Beckett University; University of New England; University of Cape Town; Durban University of Technology,"Leduc, C (corresponding author), Leeds Beckett Univ, Carnegie Appl Rugby Res CARR Ctr, Carnegie Sch Sport, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Leduc, C (corresponding author), French Rugby Federat FFR, Res Dept, Marcoussis, France.",cedric.leduc1@gmail.com,"Tee, Jason/J-7445-2019",,,,,,21,3,4,1,11,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1555-0265,1555-0273,,INT J SPORT PHYSIOL,Int.

We employ a tournament structure of the bargaining interaction to eliminate the potential for fairness to influence behavior. Comparing the results of the tournament game with two control treatments affords us a clean test of subgame perfection as well as a measure fairness-induced play. We find after 10 iterations of play that about half of all non-subgame-perfect demands are due to fairness, and the rest to imperfect learning. However, as suggested by models of learning, we also confirm that the ultimatum game presents an especially difficult environment for learning subgame perfection.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Virginia,"Andreoni, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",andreoni@ucsd.edu,"; Andreoni, James/ABD-4433-2021","Andreoni, James/0000-0003-0679-2371;",,,,,20,22,23,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Even if these assumptions hold, one would nonetheless fail to estimate direct effects using standard methods, for example, stratification or regression modeling, when the treatment influences confounding factors. For such situations, the sequential g-estimation method for structural nested mean models has been developed for estimating controlled direct effects in point-treatment situations. In this study, we demonstrate that this method can be applied to longitudinal data with time-varying treatments and repeatedly measured intermediate variables. We sequentially estimate the parameters in two structural nested mean models: one for a repeatedly measured intermediate and the other one for direct effects of a time-varying treatment. The method was applied to data from a large primary prevention trial for coronary events, in which pravastatin was used to lower the cholesterol levels in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.

Stay-at-home orders and lockdowns of golf courses (for 5.08 +/- 2.79 months) and strength and conditioning facilities (for 6.78 +/- 3.80 months) meant that golfers had to quickly adapt their practice and training. This mixed-methods study surveyed amateur and professional golfers (n = 107), to examine the applied impact of the pandemic on their strength and conditioning, golf practice, tournament engagement, levels of stress and motivation and the impact upon diet and sleep. Results indicate reduced practice frequency and duration across various aspects of golf, as well as reduced tournament engagement. The most commonly cited limiting factors for tournament engagement were a lack of practice time (28.8%) and travel restrictions (52.5%). In general, golfers were motivated to train, with session frequency remaining consistent with pre-pandemic levels. However, golfers suffered from significantly higher levels of stress (p<.001), disturbed sleep (p= .015) and perceptions of less physical gains compared to previous years. While online support has been accessed by 53.8% of golfers, the cited lack of facilities/equipment by 71.9% raises concerns over detraining and injury risks on return to sport. Coaches are urged to monitor athlete self-report measures to manage and optimise interventions, especially in similar situations where maintaining progressive overload is challenging. Strength and conditioning and golf coaches can use this study to review their applied practices, consider benefits/limitations to online coaching and to modify future interventions.","[Langdown, Ben L.] Open Univ, Sch Educ Childhood Youth & Sport, Milton Keynes, England",Open University - UK,"Langdown, B (corresponding author), Open Univ, Sch Educ Childhood Youth & Sport, Milton Keynes, England.",ben.langdown@open.ac.uk,"Ehlert, Alex/AAH-1524-2020; Langdown, Ben/JKJ-6999-2023",,,,,,41,1,1,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1747-9541,2048-397X,,INT J SPORTS SCI COA,Int.

Fourteen girl competitive chess players participated in the 5-day Swiss chess tournament held in nine heavy and light rounds. The tournament was performed at 9:00 a.m. (first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth rounds) and 3:00 p.m. (second, fourth, sixth, and eighth rounds). Salivary cortisol and mood was measured before the tournament, before and after the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth rounds, and following the tournament (10 samples). The resting levels of salivary cortisol had considerably greater values on the first, second, third, and fourth competition days compared to 1 week before the competition (P = 0.001). The post-competition cortisol concentration was significantly higher on the second and third days than before the competition (P = 0.001). Winners had considerably higher levels of salivary cortisol compared to losers (P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in total mode disturbance (P = 0.001), anger (P = 0.009), and tension (P = 0.045) following heavy rounds (second and third day) compared to the values before the competition. At the same time, the Scores of vigor decreased significantly (P = 0.001). The findings of the present study showed participating in the official chess competition increased salivary cortisol and caused negative alterations in mood components associated with the difficulty and outcome of the match, indicating the psychological stress. Hence, psychological interventions can be used for psychological recovery of competitive chess players after the competition.","[Dovom, Marzieh Mashayekhi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Mashhad, Iran; [Fatolahi, Hoseyn] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Pardis Branch, Pardis, Iran; [Nikbin, Sina; Noktehdan, Seyed Farhad; Mohabbati, Pezhman; Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Exercise Physiol, Cent Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Bagheri, Parastoo] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Dept Sports Biomech, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Azarbayjani, MA (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Exercise Physiol, Cent Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.",mz.mashayekhi@outlook.com; hoseyn.fatolahi@pardisiau.ac.ir; sin.nikbin.spr@iauctb.ac.ir; far.noktehdan.spr@iaucht.ac.ir; pez.mohabbati.spr@iauctb.ac.ir; bageriprs@gmail.com; m_azarbayjani@iauctb.ac.ir,"Fatolahi, Hoseyn/AAJ-3646-2020; Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali/AGW-7332-2022","Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-3502-7487",,,,,58,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1090-0586,1573-3270,,APPL PSYCHOPHYS BIOF,Appl.

In the first treatment subjects play a series of basic ultimatum games. Because responders can increase comparative income by rejecting offers deemed too low, outcomes are expected to diverge from extreme divisions in the direction of equality. In the second treatment subjects play a series of ultimatum tournaments. Because rejection of low offers can only decrease comparative income, extreme splits are expected. Hence, the comparative model predicts that offers will be lower and near zero in the second treatment. The results of our experiment do not support the comparative model.

We sought to replicate their size effect, but failed to find a significant latency advantage in lexical decision for obigo words (cf. osmallo words), even though we used the same word stimuli as Sereno et al. and had almost three times as many subjects. We also examined existing data from visual word recognition megastudies (e.g., English Lexicon Project) and found that semantic size is not a significant predictor of lexical decision performance after controlling for the standard lexical variables. In summary, the null results from our lab experimentdespite a much larger subject sample size than Sereno et al.converged with our analysis of megastudy lexical decision performance, leading us to conclude that semantic size does not matter for word recognition. Discussion focuses on why semantic size (unlike some other semantic variables) is unlikely to play a role in lexical decision.","[Kang, Sean H.

In the pressure-pot environment of the tournament, teams that have the strongest sense of collective efficacy will most likely perform to their best and respond positively to the outside stressors (e.g., media interest, public expectations). In this review, the importance of collective efficacy to team performance at the World Cup in terms of team resiliency and minimising process losses is discussed. In addition, the relationship between collective efficacy and other psychological factors such as team cohesion is highlighted. From a practical perspective, an introduction to interventions to develop collective efficacy is provided. In particular, the neuroscience evidence for the use of imagery and observation interventions to improve individual collective efficacy perceptions is highlighted. It is emphasised how these interventions are particularly suited to international teams who compete together sporadically. Finally, specific recommendations are made such that practitioners might be able to implement these strategies with their teams before the World Cup.","Univ South Wales, Sch Psychol, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, M Glam, Wales",University of South Wales,"Shearer, DA (corresponding author), Univ South Wales, Sch Psychol, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, M Glam, Wales.",david.shearer@southwales.ac.uk,"Shearer, David/K-8025-2019","Shearer, David/0000-0002-5877-8160",,,,,41,7,13,0,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-1391,1536-7290,,EUR J SPORT SCI,Eur.

In humans, winning and losing situations can be considered as reward and punishment experiences, respectively. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure regional brain activity when human subjects were given feedback on their performance during a simple response time task in a fictitious competitive tournament. Lexical stimuli were used to convey positive 'win' or negative 'lose' feedback. The frequency of positive and negative trials was parametrically varied by the experimenters independently from the subjects' actual performance and unbeknownst to them. The results showed that the parametric increase of winning was associated with left amygdala activation whereas the parametric increase of losing was associated with right amygdala activation. These findings provide functional evidence that the human amygdala differentially responds to changes in magnitude of positive or negative reinforcement conveyed by lexical stimuli.","NINDS, Cognit Neurosci Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Pisa, Dept Human & Environm Sci, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; Inst Cognit Sci, F-69675 Bron, France",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); University of Pisa; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Grafman, J (corresponding author), NINDS, Cognit Neurosci Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,"Sirigu, Angela/L-4683-2017; Koechlin, Etienne/E-5061-2016; Basso, Gianpaolo/A-9208-2012; Pietrini, Pietro/Z-4202-2019","Koechlin, Etienne/0000-0002-6514-9311; Grafman, Jordan H./0000-0001-8645-4457; Basso, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-6245-9402; Pietrini, Pietro/0000-0002-6768-5556",,,,,68,116,134,0,24,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-816X,,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

Its level decreases when the reception of visual stimuli is limited. It may affect the choice of sports activities as well as overall performance. This study sought to assess the levels of selected static balance indices in visually impaired goalball players. Competitors who took part in the goalball tournament of the 2012 London Paralympic Games were included in the study (M = 42, F = 23). The athletes were divided into groups taking into account tournament level, disability experience, training experience and training loads. Static balance was assessed using AMTI AccuSway stabilographic platform (ACS Model). The study participants performed the following tests: standing on both feet with eyes open and closed (30s, single left- and right-leg stance with eyes open, single left- and right-leg stance with eyes closed (10s). The significance of differences between groups in gender, disability experience, tournament level, training loads and starting class was assessed using Mann-Whitney U test. Significant differences were noted between competitors from teams participating in the preliminary and final rounds and between competitors with training experience of up to and above 10 years. Players participating in the final phase presented a higher level of static balance, but those with longer training experience lower than less experienced athletes. No significant differences were observed in the levels of the analysed variables between males and females and within starting classes. The study revealed the significance of static balance in achieving sporting excellence in goalball.","[Bednarczuk, Grzegorz; Molik, Bartosz; Morgulec-Adamowicz, Natalia; Kosmol, Andrzej; Wiszomirska, Ida; Rutkowska, Izabela] Jozef Pilsudski Univ Phys Educ Warsaw, Fac Rehabil, Marymoncka 34, PL-00968 Warsaw 45, Poland; [Perkowski, Krzysztof] Jozef Pilsudski Univ Phys Educ Warsaw, Fac Phys Educ, Warsaw, Poland",Jozef Pilsudski University Physical Education in Warsaw; Jozef Pilsudski University Physical Education in Warsaw,"Bednarczuk, G (corresponding author), Jozef Pilsudski Univ Phys Educ Warsaw, Fac Rehabil, Marymoncka 34, PL-00968 Warsaw 45, Poland.",bednarczuk.awf@gmail.com,"Wiszomirska, Ida/A-9727-2018; Morgulec-Adamowicz, Natalia/G-3404-2017; MOLIK, BARTOSZ/U-9991-2018; Bednarczuk, Grzegorz/AAZ-5524-2020; Kosmol, Andrzej/AAZ-9156-2020; rutkowska, izabela/B-7096-2015; Molik, Bartosz/U-9991-2018","Wiszomirska, Ida/0000-0002-5838-601X; Morgulec-Adamowicz, Natalia/0000-0003-3888-633X; MOLIK, BARTOSZ/0000-0002-6690-0699; Bednarczuk, Grzegorz/0000-0003-4874-620X; Kosmol, Andrzej/0000-0002-0618-9006; Perkowski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-6309-4839; rutkowska, izabela/0000-0002-2607-3588;",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [DS. 162],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was completed within statutory activities of University of Physical Education in Warsaw (no.

We argue that adversity or setbacks may have a stronger deteriorative effect on ties made up of dissimilar individuals, prompting people to give up on such ties more easily, which, over the long run, results in people forming ties with similar others. We examine this argument in the context of Association of Tennis Professionals tournaments, using data on 9,669 unique doubles pairs involving 1,812 unique players from 99 countries from 2000 to 2020. We find that doubles pairs with players from different countries are more likely to dissolve after a setback, especially if those countries lack social trust and connections with one another; this reality further contributes to the individual player's increased tendency to collaborate with same-country players in the next tournament. Our study has direct implications for interventions for diversity and inclusion.","[Lu, Xuege (Cathy)] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Wang, Shinan] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zhang, Letian] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Northwestern University; Harvard University,"Lu, XG (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",xuegelu@umn.edu; shinan.wang@kellogg.northwestern.edu; lzhang@hbs.edu,,,Alice (Can) Wang,Alice (Can) Wang,Acknowledgments: We thank Alice (Can) Wang for excellent research assistance.

Past experience shows that this package, although broadly beneficial to societies, has not yet fully succeeded in banishing poverty. So in the context of the UN millennium development goal of halving world poverty by the year 2015, are there ways of making the package more pro-poor in the future? In 2001-2002, the author, at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and in collaboration with national partners in Asia, launched a major multi-country study that set out to answer this question. The study explored the links between irrigation and poverty alleviation in six Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Vietnam and Indonesia) with the aim of determining realistic options for increasing returns to poor farmers in low-productivity irrigated areas within the context of improving the overall performance and sustainability of the established irrigation systems. This unique mega study is based on primary data collected from over 5400 rural households covering 26 irrigation systems, supplemented with reliable secondary data and a review of global topical literature on the subject. It develops a framework for pro-poor interventions in irrigated agriculture and offers a model for designing future pro-poor projects in irrigated agriculture. This paper provides a succinct summary of the synthesized results, conclusions and lessons learnt from this major multi-country study. The summary of the lessons, pro-poor options and the guidelines presented in this paper could be useful for government policyrnakers and planners, donors, NGOs, researchers and other stakeholders involved in irrigation and rural poverty alleviation efforts in developing Asia and elsewhere.

J,"Smith, MF; Hillman, R",,,,"Smith, Mark F.; Hillman, Rob",,,A retrospective service audit of a mobile physiotherapy unit on the PGA European golf tour,PHYSICAL THERAPY IN SPORT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Golf; Sports injuries; Injury prevention,INJURIES,"Objectives: A 2-year retrospective audit was conducted to evaluate injury diagnosis and treatment provision from a mobile physiotherapy unit serving the Professional Golf Association (PGA) European Tour. Design: Across two competitive seasons (2005/06), service data was collected at 36 tournaments (18 in 2005 and 18 in 2006). Service at each tournament was from Tuesday to Sunday, and equated to 216 days in total. Each approach made to the unit throughout this time was anonymously recorded as either i) a 'contact' where an injury diagnosis and/or treatment was provided, or ii) a 'non-contact' where no service was administered and players used the on-board fitness suite. Results: Across the audit period a total of 7430 approaches were made to the unit, equating to 206 per event or 34 per service day. From all approaches 6705 'contacts' were documented with 2328 injuries recorded. A total of 9933 separate treatments were administered equating to 276 per event or 46 per day. Non-contacts equated to 725, representing only 9.8% of all approaches. Of the 2328 reported injuries, 66.6% (1551) were back-related, with 16.6% (385) and 16.8% (392), being related to upper and lower limbs, respectively. Of the 9933 treatments, 71.3% (7087) related to massage (40.7%), manipulation (15.6%) and stretching therapies (15.0%). As an overall trend, the total number of injury diagnoses and treatments increased across the 2-year period. The number of reported injuries rose by 25.6% (2005 = 1032; 2006 = 1296), whilst treatments rose by 17.2% (2005 = 4575; 2006 = 5359). Conclusions: This retrospective audit provides a valuable insight into a servicing mobile physiotherapy unit on a professional sporting tour. Findings reveal the specific type and location of injuries encountered by PGA European Tour players as well as the range of treatments administered. In developing effective support services to the professional player on tour, data presented will allow for a more structured injury management system based of typical injury occurrence and treatment provision.

In an experiment, participants first answer trivia questions, and are then asked to estimate how many questions they have answered right. In the two treatments the payoff function is skewed: either over or underestimations are punished more severe. This manipulation causes a difference in report between the two treatments and the main question is whether that changes actual beliefs. In the third part participants rate per question how likely their answer is right, and in the final part participants choose between payment per correctly answered question or a tournament.

Design: Randomized, unblinded intervention trial. Setting: McMaster University Nutrition and Metabolism Research Laboratory. Participants: Twelve highly trained male wrestlers volunteered as subjects and were randomly assigned to one of two groups (Group A, n = 6; Group B, n = 6) as defined below. Assessment of risk factors: All subjects were free of medical conditions that would preclude participation in the study and all had performed rapid weight loss at least three times/year with no medical complications. Interventions: Group A: simulated wrestling tournament, four 5-min wrestling bouts (>7 h) following a 5% body weight loss and 17 h repletion period; Group B: 5% weight loss through energy restriction (1,141 kcal/day), exercise, fluid restriction, and dehydration methods (sauna) >72 h. Main outcome measures: Group A: muscle glycogen content before and after wrestling tournament and plasma lactate after each bout; Group B: muscle glycogen before and after weight loss. Results: Group A: no significant effect on muscle glycogen concentration, yet large increases were observed in blood lactate concentrations (up to 14.7 mmol/L); Group B: weight loss resulted in a 54% (p < 0.018) reduction in muscle glycogen concentration. Conclusions: The weight loss methods commonly performed by wrestlers resulted in large decreases in muscle glycogen concentration that were largely reversed during the 17-h repletion period between weigh-in and the start of the competition; participation in a wrestling tournament did not have a significant impact upon biceps brachii glycogen concentration when ad libitum feeding is allowed between matches.",,,"MCMASTER UNIV, DEPT KINESIOL, IVOR WYNNE CTR, 1280 MAIN ST W, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4K1, CANADA.",,,,,,,,26,56,62,2,24,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1050-642X,1536-3724,,CLIN J SPORT MED,Clin.

A thematic analysis was performed to identify key themes in how players rationalize their opinions.Conclusions The gaming community differentiates between potential performance enhancers based on how problematic they are for the esports scene, with the most concern surrounding hard drugs, pharmaceuticals, and brain stimulation interventions. Participants who are more invested in competitive gaming tend to be more sceptical of enhancers and express greater concerns. Four themes were identified in the thematic analysis: (1) risk, (2) morality, (3) enhancer effects, and (4) regulation. To increase acceptance and perceived legitimacy in decision-making, it is recommended that regulators engage a variety of stakeholders in transparent decision-making processes when forming tournament rules and regulations. This will help address the fragmented regulatory landscape and prevent potential differences in the perception of tournament winners based on the governing body supervising the competition.","[Friehs, Maximilian A.] Univ Twente, Psychol Conflict Risk & Safety, Enschede, Netherlands; [Friehs, Maximilian A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Psychol, Dublin, Ireland; [Friehs, Maximilian A.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Leipzig, Germany; [Klarkowski, Madison; Phillips, Cody] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Human Comp Interact Lab, Leipzig, Germany; [Frommel, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Interact Media Grp Informat & Comp Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mandryk, Regan L.] Univ Victoria, Fac Comp Sci, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Twente; University College Dublin; Max Planck Society; Utrecht University; University of Victoria,"Friehs, MA (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Psychol Conflict Risk & Safety, Enschede, Netherlands.;Friehs, MA (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Psychol, Dublin, Ireland.;Friehs, MA (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Leipzig, Germany.",m.a.friehs@utwente.nl,"; Mandryk, Regan/HZK-7531-2023; Frommel, Julian/JVM-8038-2024; Friehs, Maximilian/GXG-4154-2022","Mandryk, Regan/0000-0003-0772-6616; Friehs, Maximilian A./0000-0002-9362-4140;",,,,,78,3,3,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9367,,FRONT SPORTS ACT LIV,Front.

But these innovations have focused on easier-to-quantify variables, like personnel selection, training, teaming, and crowd aggregation-bypassing messier constructs, like qualitative properties of forecasters' rationales. Here, we adapt methods from natural language processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to identify distinctive reasoning strategies in the rationales of top forecasters, including: (a) cognitive styles, such as dialectical complexity, that gauge tolerance of clashing perspectives and efforts to blend them into coherent conclusions and (b) the use of comparison classes or base rates to inform forecasts. In addition to these core metrics, we explore metrics derived from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Applying these tools to multiple tournaments and to forecasters of widely varying skill (from Mechanical Turkers to carefully culled superforecasters) revealed that: (a) top forecasters show higher dialectical complexity in their rationales and use more comparison classes; (b) experimental interventions, like training and teaming, that boost accuracy also influence NLP profiles of rationales, nudging them in a superforecasterdirection.

Although they are called rectangles, the number of rows and the number of columns are not necessarily distinct.

Each treatment of the design appears a definite number of times in each row and also a definite number of times in each column (these parameters also being not necessarily distinct). When k = 2, the design is said to have block size two. Regular-graph semi-Latin rectangles have the additional property that the treatment concurrences between any two pairs of distinct treatments differ by at most one. Constructions for semi-Latin rectangles of this class with k = 2 which have v treatments, v/2 rows and v columns, where v is even, are given in Bailey and Monod (2001). These give the smallest designs when v is even. Here we give constructions for smallest designs with k = 2 when v is odd.

Methods Injury incidence was defined as a medical consultation by a tournament physician and in-event treatment frequency as the mean total number of followup medical/ physiotherapy consultations (2013-2016 tournaments only). Data were collated by sex, injury region and type and reported as frequencies per 10 000 game exposures. Incidence rate s +/- 95% CI and rate ratios were used to test effects for injury, sex and year. Results Female players experienced more injuries than male players (201.7 vs 148.6). The shoulder (5.1 +/- 1.1 injuries per year), foot (3.2 +/- 1.1), wrist (3.1 +/- 1.5) and knee (3.1 +/- 1.1) were the most commonly injured regions among females. Knee (3.5 +/- 1.6), ankle (2.3 +/- 1.3) and thigh (2.3 +/- 1.5) were the most prevalent male injuries. Upper arm injuries and in-event treatment frequency increased by = 2.4 times in both sexes over the 5-year period. Muscle injuries were most frequent. There was a greater than twofold increase in men and women with stress fractures over the 5-year period. The torso region, including the neck, thoracic spine, trunk and abdominal, lumbar spine, hip and groin, pelvis/ buttock, attracted high in-event treatment frequencies in both sexes. Conclusion Investigation of injury at the Australian Open suggests that females are more commonly injured than males. Upper and lower extremity injuries affected females while lower limb injuries were more prominent in males. There was an increasing rate of in-event treatments of upper limb and torso injuries as well as stress fractures during the observation period.","[Gescheit, Danielle T.; Cormack, Stuart J.] Australian Catholic Univ, Sch Exercise Sci, Fitzroy, Vic, Australia; [Gescheit, Danielle T.; Kovalchik, Stephanie; Reid, Machar] Tennis Australia, Game Insight Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gescheit, Danielle T.; Wood, Tim O.; Omizzolo, Melanie] Tennis Australia, Performance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Duffield, Rob] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sport & Exercise Discipline Grp, Moore Pk, Ultimo, NSW, Australia; [Kovalchik, Stephanie] Victoria Univ, Inst Sport Exercise & Act Living, Footscray, Vic, Australia",Australian Catholic University; University of Technology Sydney; Victoria University,"Gescheit, DT (corresponding author), Private Bag 6060, Richmond South, Vic, Australia.",dgescheit@tennis.com.au,"Duffield, Rob/G-2660-2017; Cormack, Stuart/AAC-8537-2019","Duffield, Rob/0000-0002-5641-1314; Cormack, Stuart/0000-0002-1846-5397",,,,,26,42,44,1,39,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0306-3674,1473-0480,,BRIT J SPORT MED,Br.

In an online experiment, we analyze how different incentive schemes and the corresponding feedback affect distributional preferences and beliefs. In six different treatments, we vary the incentive scheme (competitive vs team incentives) for a real-effort task and the feedback participants receive at the end of the real-effort task. Subsequently, we measure participants' social value orientation (SVO), a proxy for distributional preferences, and the corresponding beliefs about other's SVO. If no feedback is provided, participants show stronger SVOs if they are incentivized by team incentives in comparison to piecerate remuneration. Surprisingly, this positive effect prevails under competitive incentives without feedback. With feedback about relative performance, the spillover effects differ between the incentive schemes. Under competitive incentives, participants show lower SVOs (negative spillovers), but only for low performers. Under team incentives, we find negative spillovers on preferences for high performers and positive spillovers for low performers.

The handling associated with hook removal and return of the fish to their environment can cause physical damage to the epidermal layer of the fish which may affect the condition and survival of released fish. This study investigated possible sources of epithelial damage associated with several different handling methods (i.e., landing net types, interactions with different boat floor surfaces, tournament procedures) commonly used in recreational angling for two popular freshwater sport fish species, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Epithelial damage was examined using fluorescein, a non-toxic dye, which has been shown to detect latent epithelial damage. Northern pike exhibited extensive epithelial damage after exposure to several of the induced treatments (i.e., interaction with a carpeted surface, knotted nylon net, and line rolling) but relatively little epithelial damage when exposed to others (i.e., knotless rubber nets, smooth boat surfaces, or lip gripping devices). Largemouth bass did not show significant epithelial damage for any of the treatments, with the exception of fish caught in a semi-professional live release tournament. The detection of latent injuries using fluorescein can be an important management tool as it provides visual examples of potential damage that can be caused by different handling methods. Such visualizations can be used to encourage fish-friendly angler behaviour and enhance the survival and welfare of released fish. It can also be used to test new products that are intended to or claim to reduce injury to fish that are to be released. Future research should evaluate the relationship between different levels of epithelial damage and mortality across a range of environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The tournament's physical and psychological strains on competitors may have consequences for their overall health. The purpose of this study is to look at the training load and the acute-to-chronic workload ratio (ACWR) and to evaluate the wellness on the Malaysia Rugby squad during the Asia Rugby Men's Championship 2023. The study enlisted the participation of 30 Malaysia Rugby squad members. Throughout the competition, training load data such as session time, session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE), and numerous wellness indicators such as fatigue, sleep quality, mood, muscular soreness, and stress level were thoroughly evaluated. The ACWR was determined by dividing the chronic workload rolling average by the acute workload rolling average. The data demonstrated differences in training load patterns and ACWR values and self-report questionnaires were used to collect data for wellness status throughout the competition. The study emphasizes the significance of monitoring training load to optimize player performance and reduce the risk of injury during strenuous rugby tournaments. The study reveals wellness difficulties faced by Malaysia Rugby players at ARMC 2023, guiding personalized interventions to enhance well-being and performance during international rugby games. It also enhances understanding of training load management approaches and may guide future training methods for similar events.","[Baki, Mohd Hafizuddin; Madarsa, Nor Ikhmar; Abd Malek, Nor Fazila] Sultan Idris Educ Univ, Tanjong Malim, Malaysia",Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris,"Baki, MH (corresponding author), Sultan Idris Educ Univ, Tanjong Malim, Malaysia.",m.hafizuddin@fsskj.upsi.edu.my; norikhmarmadarsa@me.com; fazila.malek@fsskj.upsi.edu.my,"Baki, Mohd Hafizuddin/EPF-6482-2022",,,,"The authors would like to thank the Malaysia Rugby team for taking part in this study and to congratulate them on their achievements at the Asia Rugby Men's Champion-ship 2023.

Yips-affected golfers add approximately 4.7 strokes to their scores for 18 holes of golf, and have more forearm electromyogram activity and higher competitive anxiety than nonaffected golfers in both high and low anxiety putting conditions; The aetiology of the yips is not clear. Objective: To determine whether the yips is a neurological problem exacerbated by anxiety, or whether the behaviour is initiated by anxiety and results in a permanent neuromuscular impediment. Methods: In phase I, golf professionals assisted investigators in developing a yips questionnaire that was sent to tournament players (< 12 handicap) to establish the prevalence and characteristics of the yips. Phase II measured putting behaviour in scenarios that contribute to the yips response. Four self-reported yips and 3 nonaffected golfers putted 3 scenarios using an uncorrected grip and a standard length putter Heart rate was superimposed on the videotape and the putter grip was instrumented with strain gauges to measure grip force. Electromyograms and relative putting performance were also measured. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 2630 tournament players, of whom 1031 (39%) responded (986 men and 45 women). Of these, 541 (52%) perceived they experienced the yips compared with 490 (48%) who did not. Yips-affected golfers reported that the most troublesome putts were 3, 4 and 2 feet (0.9, 1.2 and 0.6 metres) from the hole. Fast, downhill, left-to-right breaking putts and tournament play also elicited the yips response. Golfers affected by the yips had a faster mean heart rate, increased electromyogram activity patterns and exerted more grip force than nonaffected golfers and had a poorer putting performance. Conclusions: For <10 handicap male golfers and <12 handicap female golfers, the prevalence of the yips is between 32.5% and 47.7%, a high proportion of serious golfers. This high prevalence suggests that medical practitioners need to understand the aetiology of the yips phenomenon so that interventions can be identified and tested for effectiveness in alleviating symptoms. Although previous investigators concluded that the yips isa neuromuscular impediment aggravated but not caused by anxiety, we believe the yips represents a continuum on which 'choking' (anxiety-related) and dystonia symptoms anchor the extremes. The aetiology may well be an interaction of psychoneuromuscular influences. Future research to test the effect of medications such as -blockers should assist in better identifying the contributions these factors make to the yips phenomenon.","Mayo Clin, Ctr Sports Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; Mayo Clin, Orthoped Biomech Lab, Rochester, MN USA; Mayo Clin, Dept Orthoped Surg, Rochester, MN USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Exercise Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; Mayo Clin, Div Endocrinol, Dept Internal Med, Rochester, MN USA",Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Mayo Clinic,"Smith, AM (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Ctr Sports Med, Desk L-C, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",,"; Hay, Iain/I-2525-2014","Kaufman, Kenton/0000-0002-7311-3781; Sabick, Michelle/0000-0001-9663-3969",,,,,42,62,71,1,26,ADIS INTERNATIONAL LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 10, NEW ZEALAND",0112-1642,,,SPORTS MED,Sports Med.,DEC,2000,30,6,,,,,423,437,,10.2165/00007256-200030060-00004,http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/00007256-200030060-00004,,,15,Sport Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sport Sciences,385DE,11132124,,,,7/25/25,WOS:000165986000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This negatively impacts many aspects of society, including organised sport. As the world's most watched sporting event, the FIFA World Cup commands particular attention around the threat of extreme heat. The 2022 tournament in Qatar was moved from summer to winter in response to this threat, and now attention turns to the 2026 tournament in North America with extreme heat risk across many of the 16 host locations. We examine this risk by modelling wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) - a widely used measure of heat stress - for the host locations using hourly meteorological data for the period 2003-2022. Our results show that 14 out of 16 host locations exceed WBGTs of 28 degrees C, with four (nine) exceeding this threshold more than half the time during afternoons across the mean (hottest year) of the 20 year record. This threshold is important as the level beyond which some football governing bodies recommend match delay or postponement. A climatically sound argument is therefore presented to reschedule kick-off times outside the hottest afternoon hours for the host locations with highest heat risk at which no indoor air conditioned environment exists - primarily Miami and Monterrey, but also Philadelphia, Kansas City, Boston and New York. This study highlights the need to carefully assess heat risk ahead of major sporting events to help inform any potential interventions needed in the scheduling of matches and competitions in a warming climate.","[Mullan, Donal; Flood, Nuala; Kielt, Aimee C.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, North Ireland; [Barr, Iestyn] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Manchester, England; [Brannigan, Neil] Ulster Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Coleraine, North Ireland; [Gibson, Oliver R.] Brunel Univ London, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Hambly, Catherine] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Kennedy-Asser, Alan T.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, England; [Matthews, Tom] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Orr, Madeleine] Univ Toronto, Fac Kinesiol & Phys Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Queens University Belfast; Manchester Metropolitan University; Ulster University; Brunel University; University of Aberdeen; University of Bristol; University of London; King's College London; University of Toronto,"Mullan, D (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, North Ireland.",D.Mullan@qub.ac.uk,"; Barr, Iestyn/L-2596-2013; Matthews, Tom/KIG-0818-2024","Brannigan, Neil/0000-0002-2604-3610; Flood, Nuala/0000-0002-7200-8218; Mullan, Donal/0000-0002-6363-3150; Barr, Iestyn/0000-0002-9066-8738; Kielt, Aimee Catherine/0009-0001-4822-1510; Kennedy-Asser, Alan/0000-0001-5143-8932",,,,,55,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Unlike our prior, we find that men and women are equally likely to compete in our baseline no-delay condition, with a task considered to be gender-neutral. We discuss how the gender gap in entry rates does not appear to be omnipresent, but instead depends on circumstances and beliefs. Men are significantly more likely than women to provisionally sign up for a delayed tournament when a future opportunity to study for the task is available; however, this difference in rates is evanescent, disappearing when the actual choice is made later. Women who have access to studying see an increase in performance, while men do not. Delaying competition by itself does not generate a gender gap in competitiveness. We explore a variety of potential reasons for why knowing one has access to studying produces the gender gap in tournament entry. We rule out differences in risk aversion, confidence, and task stereotypes. Control treatments where the delay itself is a choice rule out the possibility that the forced nature of delay may be at the root of the overly competitive initial decisions by the men. We conjecture that these patterns may arise due to men being more confident than women and making choices based on an overly ambitious view about future selves' ability to study.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, most professional tennis players resource strength and conditioning specialists on a full- or part-time basis. As tennis play is characterised by intricate bio-energetics, planning specific strength and conditioning interventions represents a significant challenge for the specialist. Further, where game physiology and mechanics have been described extensively, critiques of the efficacy of different training initiatives are far less common.

Three groups participated in focus groups and in-depth interviews on experiences with the program: (1) a subset of 15 participants, (2) 15 family members, and (3) five intervention coaches. Results suggest that participants first reduced substance use on tournament days and then gradually reduced to practice days and beyond. Families suggested that keeping young men occupied and encouragement of prosocial behaviors was critical to risk reduction and led to increased community respect for the men. Coaches noted that behavioral and attitudinal changes were incremental and slow.

Design: A cross-sectional study of ECGs and ECHOs conducted as part of precompetition medical assessment for national male soccer teams preparing for various Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) tournaments in 2016 and 2017. Setting: Ghana National Football Association. Participants: One hundred fifty-nine players playing for the National male soccer teams preparing for tournaments in 2016 and 2017. Interventions: Precompetition medical assessment using ECGs and ECHOs. Main Outcome Measures: Number of athletes with abnormal ECGs and ECHO findings. Results: Twenty-three percent of the players had abnormal ECGs. Nine percent of the participants had T-wave inversions in lateral leads (V-5-V-6). Sokolow-Lyon criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were present in 64% of participants. Thirty-six (23%) players had left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) >= 13 mm, with no player exceeding 16 mm. Four percent of players had left ventricular cavity dimension greater than 60 mm. Relative wall thickness >0.42 was present in 44% of the players. Conclusions: Uncommon ECG changes seem to be more common in elite Ghanaian soccer players compared with previously reported results for Caucasians and even mixed populations of black athletes. Although ST elevation, T-wave inversions, and LVWT up to 15 mm are common, ST depression, deep T-waves in lateral leads, and LVWT >= 16 mm always warrant further clinical and scientific investigations.","[Pambo, Prince] Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Ho, Ghana; [Pambo, Prince; Agbodzakey, Hope] Ghana Hlth Serv, Civil Serv Stadium Clin, Sch Allied Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Pambo, Prince; Scharhag, Jurgen] Saarland Univ, Inst Sports & Prevent Med, Sports Med Dept, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Adu-Adadey, Martin] Korle Bu Teaching Hosp, Natl Cardiothorac Ctr, Accra, Ghana; [Scharhag, Jurgen] Univ Vienna, Dept Sports Med Exercise Physiol & Prevent, Vienna, Austria",Ghana Health Service; Saarland University; University of Vienna,"Pambo, P (corresponding author), Saarland Univ, Inst Sports & Prevent Med, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",dr.pambo@yahoo.com,,,Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFUND); Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFUND); Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),P.

We randomly assigned 3784 students, studying in 216 classrooms to control and treatment groups. On average, we find a positive but statistically insignificant effect of the treatment on attendance rates. However, we find the intervention increases attendance for students in the middle and lower end of the attendance distribution by 3.8-6.5 percentage points, depending on their ranking in the distribution and the number of students they compete with. Our heterogeneity analysis suggests that such an intervention may be more effective for students of school-going age, particularly boys and low-ability students.","[Arora, Puneet] Management Dev Inst Gurgaon, Gurugram, India; [Musaddiq, Tareena] Math Policy Res, Princeton, NJ USA; [Arora, Puneet] Management Dev Inst Gurgaon, Econ & Publ Policy, C-24,Scholars Bldg,Sect 17, Gurugram 122007, Haryana, India",Management Development Institute (MDI); Mathematica; Management Development Institute (MDI),"Arora, P (corresponding author), Management Dev Inst Gurgaon, Econ & Publ Policy, C-24,Scholars Bldg,Sect 17, Gurugram 122007, Haryana, India.",puneet.arora@mdi.ac.in; tmusaddiq@mathematica-mpr.com,"; Arora, Puneet/GZN-1044-2022","Arora, Puneet/0000-0001-5899-1386;",,,,,64,0,0,3,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how sport clubs can leverage participation from local, medium-sized, elite sport events. Design/methodology/approach This study used an action research approach where researchers, along with representative stakeholders from two elite tennis tournaments and 23 local tennis organizations, collaborated to develop and implement a series of interventions as part of a wider leveraging plan. The interventions were developed and evaluated in one cycle of action research that incorporated predominantly qualitative research methods. Findings The interventions stimulated the interest of event spectators by offering a free tennis lesson at a participating club. However, the conversion from interest to club participation was limited. Practical implications Key recommendations for clubs to leverage participation from a medium-sized event include: a leveraging plan should consider the resources and capacity of local community sport clubs; clubs should act collectively and collaboratively; and clubs should have a strong physical presence at the event(s). Originality/value Regional sports organizations can utilize existing collaborative networks to enable community clubs to design and implement event-leveraging initiatives. This study also highlights the limited capacity of community sport clubs to leverage participation outcomes from medium-sized annual events. The use of collaborative networks may ameliorate the organizational capacity deficiencies of clubs.","[Hoskyn, Katharine; Dickson, Geoff] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Sotiriadou, Popi] Griffith Univ Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld, Australia",Auckland University of Technology; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Hoskyn, K (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand.",katharine.hoskyn@aut.ac.nz; geoff.dickson@aut.ac.nz; p.sotiriadou@griffith.edu.au,"; Sotiriadou, Popi/M-3410-2019; Dickson, Geoff/ABC-2052-2021","Dickson, Geoff/0000-0002-9913-0125; Sotiriadou, Popi/0000-0003-2498-2179; Hoskyn, Katharine/0000-0003-0606-7794",,,,,38,16,17,6,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-4503,1758-8049,,MARK INTELL PLAN,Mark.

We aimed to determine longitudinal serum fatty acid profiles in preterm infants and how the profiles are affected by enteral and parenteral lipid sources. Methods: Cohort study analyzing fatty acid data from the Mega Donna Mega study, a randomized control trial with infants born <28 weeks of gestation (n = 204) receiving standard nutrition or daily enteral lipid supplementation with arachidonic acid (AA):docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100:50 mg/kg/day). Infants received an intravenous lipid emulsion containing olive oil:soybean oil (4:1). Infants were followed from birth to postmenstrual age 40 weeks. Levels of 31 different fatty acids from serum phospholipids were determined by GC-MS and reported in relative (mol%) and absolute concentration (mmol l-1) units. Results: Higher parenteral lipid administration resulted in lower serum proportion of AA and DHA relative to other fatty acids during the first 13 weeks of life (p < 0.001 for the 25th vs the 75th percentile). The enteral AA:DHA supplement increased the target fatty acids with little impact on other fatty acids. The absolute concentration of total phospholipid fatty acids changed rapidly in the first weeks of life, peaking at day 3, median (Q1-Q3) 4452 (3645-5466) mmol l-1, and was positively correlated to the intake of parenteral lipids. Overall, infants displayed common fatty acid trajectories over the study period. However, remarkable differences in fatty acid patterns were observed depending on whether levels were expressed in relative or absolute units. For example, the relative levels of many LCPUFAs, including DHA and AA, declined rapidly after birth while their absolute concentrations increased in the first week of life. For DHA, absolute levels were significantly higher compared to cord blood from day 1 until postnatal week 16 (p < 0.001). For AA, absolute postnatal levels were lower compared to cord blood from week 4 throughout the study period (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data show that parenteral lipids aggravate the postnatal loss of LCPUFAs seen in preterm infants and that serum AA available for accretion is below that in utero.

The program was designed to help intelligence analysts make better probability judgments, which required posing rapidly resolvable questions. From a signal detection theory perspective, the superforecasting and Taleb et al. programs are complementary, not contradictory (a point Taleb and Tetlock (2013) recognized). The superforecasting program aims at achieving high hit rates at low cost in false-positives, whereas Taleb et al. prioritize alerting us to systemic risk, even if that entails a high false-positive rate. Proponents of each program should, however, acknowledge weaknesses in their cases. It is unclear: (a) how Taleb et al. (2022) can justify extreme error-avoidance trade-offs, without tacit probability judgments of rare, high-impact events; (b) how much superforecasting interventions can improve probability judgments of such events.

A job shop scheduling problem with interval processing time is first described and then a population-based neighborhood search (PNS) is presented to optimize the interval makespan of the problem. In PNS, an ordered operation-based representation is used and a decoding procedure is constructed by using operations of interval numbers, in which there are no approximate treatments. It is proved that the possible actual makespan of each schedule are contained in its interval makespan. A swap operation and binary tournament selection are applied to update the population.

Virtually all models of orthographic coding that allow calculation of orthographic similarity measures predict that zjudge should be the better prime because zjudge contains all the letters in JUDGE in their correct order whereas zudge does not. Nonetheless, Adelman et al.'s (2014) megastudy data indicated no difference in the effectiveness of these two prime types. The present experiments provide additional support for the conclusion of no difference between these two prime types with the only observed difference being a small zudge prime advantage in Experiment 1b (sandwich priming). These results suggest that models of orthographic coding/word recognition may be well served by allowing inconsistent information (e.g., the z in both zjudge and zudge indicates that the presented prime is not JUDGE) to be given considerable weight during the orthographic coding/word recognition process.","[Lupker, Stephen J.; Spinelli, Giacomo] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Davis, Colin J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Psychol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Bristol,"Lupker, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",lupker@uwo.ca,"; Davis, Chris/KBA-9010-2024; Spinelli, Giacomo/AFE-8498-2022","Davis, Colin/0000-0001-5814-5104; Spinelli, Giacomo/0000-0002-3913-8109",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-3354]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [A6333],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This research was partially supported by an Economic and Social Research Council Grant RES-000-22-3354 to Colin J.

Beginning in the late 1940s catch rates began to decline, leading to reductions in tarpon-related activities including abandonment of lucrative tournaments. Desires to restore these valuable fisheries in Texas waters have prompted proposals for management interventions, including culture and stocking of hatchery-reared tarpon. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Coastal Fisheries Division policies require examinations of the genetic consequences of enhancement programs prior to implementation of any stockings. In order to determine stock structure and estimate gene flow in the Gulf of Mexico, tarpon were collected from sites distributed between the Bay of Campeche in the southern Gulf and the Florida Keys in the eastern Gulf. Four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. Each fragment was then digested with a suite of restriction enzymes and the resulting fragment patterns (RFLPs) were analyzed to infer population structure and gene flow.","Perry R Bass Marine Fisheries Res Stn, Texas Pks & Wildlife Dept, Palacios, TX 77465 USA",,"Ward, R (corresponding author), Perry R Bass Marine Fisheries Res Stn, Texas Pks & Wildlife Dept, Palacios, TX 77465 USA.",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,6,GULF CARIBBEAN FISHERIES INST GCFI,FT PIERCE,"56OO US HIGHWAY 1 N, FT PIERCE, FL 34946 USA",,,,,,,2004,,,,,,,373,383,,,,,,11,Fisheries,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Fisheries,BBB34,,,,,7/25/25,WOS:000224516900030,View Full Record in Web of Science

It performs well in discrete error spaces but not on the continuous-valued problems that compose most system identification tasks. In this paper, we develop a new form of lexicase selection for symbolic regression, named epsilon-lexicase selection, that redefines the pass condition for individuals on each test case in a more effective way. We run a series of experiments on real-world and synthetic problems with several treatments of epsilon and quantify how epsilon affects parent selection and model performance. epsilon-lexicase selection is shown to be effective for regression, producing better fit models compared to other techniques such as tournament selection and age-fitness Pareto optimization. We demonstrate that epsilon can be adapted automatically for individual test cases based on the population performance distribution. Our experiments show that epsilon-lexicase selection with automatic epsilon produces the most accurate models across tested problems with negligible computational overhead. We show that behavioral diversity is exceptionally high in lexicase selection treatments, and that epsilon-lexicase selection makes use of more fitness cases when selecting parents than lexicase selection, which helps explain the performance improvement.","[La Cava, William; Danai, Kourosh] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Spector, Lee] Hampshire Coll, Sch Cognit Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"La Cava, W (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",wlacava@umass.edu; lspector@hampshire.edu; danai@engin.umass.edu,,"Spector, Lee/0000-0001-5299-4797; La Cava, William/0000-0002-1332-2960",Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1129139] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,,33,92,97,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4206-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,741,748,,10.1145/2908812.2908898,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908898,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BF5UN,,Green Submitted,,,7/25/25,WOS:000382659200094,View Full Record in Web of Science

For a national football federation, this includes the transport of players between club and camp/tournament commitments, which is often a point of contention between respective organisations [2]. Partly this contention results from the effects of travel, whereby jet lag and travel fatigue can negatively affect physical performance [3-5] and athlete wellbeing [6, 7]. Given the scarcity of data on elite players following travel, an initial step for any national football federation is to understand the volume and nature of travel undertaken by national team players. Such insight may better identify the schedule, timelines and needs of athletes' post travel. Better awareness of these travel needs can help maximise availability for training and minimise the impact of travel related stresses on performance or wellbeing. However, the regularity and volume of travel to national football team commitments has not previously been described. Further, travel demands are likely to vary significantly based on the location of the athlete and the national team camp. For countries outside of Europe, such as Australia, the travel demands and ensuing effects on player preparation can be substantial for both arrival into national team and on return to clubs [7]. Hence, detailed information regarding the type, frequency, and extent of travel for national team duties is important to aid in planning optimal travel schedules and interventions to assist players for international or club duty.","[Clements, Ewan; Lu, Donna; Duffield, Rob] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil, Sydney, Australia; [Clements, Ewan; Ehrmann, Fabian; Clark, Andrew; Jones, Mark; Lu, Donna; Duffield, Rob] Football Australia, Sydney, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Clements, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil, Sydney, Australia.",Ewan.J.Clements@student.uts.edu.au,"Duffield, Rob/G-2660-2017",,,,,,26,5,5,1,2,TERMEDIA PUBLISHING HOUSE LTD,POZNAN,"KLEEBERGA 2, POZNAN, 61-615, POLAND",0860-021X,2083-1862,,BIOL SPORT,Biol.

Methods: Travel schedules from 355 national-team trips (50 elite soccer players) were verified using an online flight database. All players provided perceptual ratings of fatigue, sleep quality, soreness, and stress to calculate changes in scores up to 2 days after travel. Trips were categorized as <3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, or 9+ time zone changes, along with travel direction (eastward or westward). The pretravel to posttravel changes in perceptual ratings at days 1 and 2 postarrival were compared between time zone change and travel direction with linear mixed models. Results: For every time zone crossed, poorer ratings of perceptual fatigue (beta = 0.068, P <.001), sleep (beta = 0.095, P <.001), soreness (beta = 0.0049, P <.001), and total wellness (beta = 0.214, P <.001) were observed. However, the models explained only small proportions of the variation in postflight perceptual responses (7%-18%). Regardless, travel across 9+ time zones resulted in significantly worse perceived fatigue, sleep, and total wellness for days 1 and 2 postarrival compared with travel with <6 time zones (P <.05). Additionally, fatigue, sleep, and total scores were worse on day 2 following trips of 9+ time zones. Eastward travel resulted in poorer sleep ratings (beta = 0.52, P <.001) than westward travel within time zone groupings. Conclusions: Perceptual ratings of fatigue and sleep become progressively worse as travel increases in national-team soccer players, especially after travel across 9+ time zones and eastward travel.","[Clements, Ewan; Duffield, Rob] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil, Fac Hlth, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Clements, Ewan; Ehrmann, Fabian; Clark, Andrew; Jones, Mark; McCall, Alan; Duffield, Rob] Football Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Clements, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil, Fac Hlth, Broadway, NSW, Australia.;Clements, E (corresponding author), Football Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",ewan.j.clements@student.uts.edu.au,"Duffield, Rob/G-2660-2017","Clements, Ewan/0000-0003-4697-7784",,,,,32,5,5,1,8,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1555-0265,1555-0273,,INT J SPORT PHYSIOL,Int.

Activity profile included rally duration (RD), resting time between points (RTP), resting time between games (RTG), resting time between sets (RTS), resting time (RT), effective playing time (EPT), total match time (TMT), work-to-rest ratio (W: R), shots per rally (SPR), shots per game (SPG), shots per set (SPS), shots per match (SPM), shot frequency (shots/second) (SPSc), and type of shots. Results showed that RTG and RT was longer at the Australian Open than at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, and the number of forehand (F) shots at Roland Garros was higher than at Wimbledon. The most common tennis shots are the F, the backhand (B), the first service and the volley (V), and more than 50% of the total shots in a match come from the baseline and mid court game. These results show that in women's doubles the stimuli are short and intense and that net game is very important.","[Borderias, Marcos; Baiget, Ernest] Univ Barcelona Ub, Inst Nacl Educ Fis Catalunya Inefc, Phys Act & Sport, Barcelona, Spain; [Fernandez-Fernandez, Jaime] Univ Leon, Fac Phys Act & Sports Sci, Leon, Spain; [Martinez-Gallego, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Fac Phys Act & Sports Sci, Valencia, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universidad de Leon; University of Valencia,"Martínez-Gallego, R (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Phys Act & Sports Sci, Valencia, Spain.",Rafael.martinez-gallego@uv.es,"; Fernandez, Jaime/AAE-1568-2022; Martínez-Gallego, Rafael/ABH-8909-2020; Baiget, Ernest/S-5414-2016","Fernandez-Fernandez, Jaime/0000-0002-5284-303X; Martinez-Gallego, Rafael/0000-0002-8849-6463; Baiget, Ernest/0000-0002-2059-2846",,,,,47,6,6,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2474-8668,1474-8185,,INT J PERF ANAL SPOR,Int.

Thus, it is popular among the older adults. It is known that older adults often suffer from rotator cuff tears (RCTs), which may affect tennis activity. However, the prevalence and influence of RCTs on tennis play among older players are not well-known. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of RCTs in older tennis players and its impact on physical findings and shoulder function. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Fifty-three tennis players (mean age: 70.7 y; range: 60-83 y) participating in a recreational-level tennis tournament were examined in this study. An ultrasonographic examination of both shoulders was performed to detect RCTs. Relationships between RCTs of the dominant shoulder and clinical findings, shoulder pain, and shoulder function including range of motion, shoulder strength, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand-Sports Module score were assessed. Results: RCTs were detected in 19 (36%) dominant shoulders and 6 (11%) nondominant shoulders. Asymptomatic RCTs were detected in 11 (58%) dominant shoulders and 5 (83%) nondominant shoulders. Increased crepitus and more positive results in the empty can test, and infraspinatus test were observed in the dominant shoulders with RCTs than in those without; however, there was no difference in shoulder pain, range of motion; strength; Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score; and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand-Sports Module score between the players with and without RCTs. Conclusions: One-third of the older tennis players in this study had RCTs in the dominant shoulder with some positive physical sign of an RCT. However, shoulder pain and shoulder function did not differ between the players with and without RCTs, suggesting that RCTs had a minor impact on the tennis performance in the participants of this study.","[Harada, Yohei; Yokoya, Shin; Sumimoto, Yasuhiko; Adachi, Nobuo] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hiroshima, Japan; [Iwahori, Yusuke] Asahi Hosp, Sports Med & Joint Ctr, Kasugai, Japan; [Kajita, Yukihiro; Deie, Masataka] Aichi Med Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Nagakute, Japan",Hiroshima University; Aichi Medical University,"Harada, Y (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Hiroshima, Japan.",hyarada@gmail.com,"Yokoya, Shin/K-8515-2019",,,,,,35,3,4,1,4,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1056-6716,1543-3072,,J SPORT REHABIL,J.

This systematic review sought to appraise the literature available on 120-min of soccer-specific exercise, with a view to identifying practical recommendations and future research opportunities. Methods: The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Independent researchers performed a systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO in May 2019, with the following keywords entered in various combinations: ???soccer???, ???football???, ???extra-time???, ???extra time???, ???extratime???, ???120 minutes???, ???120 min???, ???additional 30 minutes???, and ???additional 30 min???. Results: The search yielded an initial 73 articles. Following the screening process, 11 articles were accepted for analyses. Articles were subsequently organized into the following 5 categories: movement demands of ET, performance responses to ET, physiological and neuromuscular response during ET, nutritional interventions, and recovery and ET. The results highlighted that during competitive match-play, players cover 5%-12% less distance relative to match duration (i.e., meters per minute) during ET compared to the preceding 90 min. Reductions in technical performance (i.e., shot speed, number of passes and dribbles) were also observed during ET. Additionally, carbohydrate provision may attenuate and improve dribbling performance during ET. Moreover, objective and subjective measures of recovery may be further compromised following ET when compared to 90 min. Conclusion: Additional investigations are warranted to further substantiate these findings and identify interventions to improve performance during ET.","[Field, Adam; Naughton, Robert Joseph; Haines, Matthew; Lui, Steve; Corr, Liam David; Harper, Liam David] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Russell, Mark] Leeds Trin Univ, Sch Social & Hlth Sci, Brownberrie Lane, Leeds LS18 5HD, W Yorkshire, England; [Page, Richard Michael] Edge Hill Univ, Dept Sport Phys Act, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England",University of Huddersfield; Edge Hill University,"Field, A (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",Adam.Field@hud.ac.uk,"; Page, Richard/J-9502-2019; Field, Adam/AAW-5661-2020; Naughton, Robert/L-9300-2019; Harper, Liam/I-7866-2019","Russell, Mark/0000-0002-7305-1090; Field, Adam/0000-0002-2600-6182; Corr, Liam/0000-0001-7439-1372; Harper, Liam/0000-0002-2089-4799;",,,,,57,19,19,1,21,SHANGHAI UNIV SPORT,SHANGHAI,"EDITORIAL BOARD, 650 QINGYUANHUAN RD, SHANGHAI, 200438, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-2546,2213-2961,,J SPORT HEALTH SCI,J.

We then imputed annual injury rates per 10000 using a range of published estimates of martial arts participation available from a national survey. Rates of injury in males and females were 2300 and 1033 per 10000 (0.3% participation) and 575 and 258 per 10000 (1.2% participation). Injuries were most frequently reported in karate (33%) and taekwondo (14%). The most common mechanisms of injury were falls, throws and jumps (33%). Fractures (20%) were the most frequently reported type of injury and the lower limb was the most common site of injury (41%). Conclusions: Results provide a foundation for potential interventions with a focus on falls, the use of weapons, participation in tournaments, as well as head and neck trauma.","[McPherson, Mark; Pickett, William] Queens Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Pickett, William] Queens Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada,"Pickett, W (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Kingston, ON, Canada.",will.pickett@queensu.ca,,,Clinical Research Centre at Kingston General Hospital; Child Injury Section of the Public Health Agency of Canada,Clinical Research Centre at Kingston General Hospital; Child Injury Section of the Public Health Agency of Canada,"We thank Kathy Bowes and Dr. Rob Brison (Medical Director of Kingston CHIRPP) for their assistance, as well as the Clinical Research Centre at Kingston General Hospital for their support of this project.

We find that for the data on real GDP growth, the panel data approach reveals the best performance under the criteria of evaluating the quality of a model. The estimation results show that Xiangyang's real GDP growth rate rose by about 1.43% annually after the renaming reform. However, further discussions show that the annual growth rate of the tertiary industry decreased by 1.59%, which contradicts the mechanism of the brand effect of the reform. The statistical inference demonstrates that even if a city did not implement the city-renaming reform in 2010, the probability of obtaining an effect as large as Xiangyang's would be 25.9%. Therefore, the effect of the city-renaming reform is insignificant and other policy interventions-rather than the city-renaming reform promote economic growth in Xiangyang. In summary, policymakers cannot win a Promotion Tournament by renaming cities.","[Guo, Jing; Zhang, Zhengyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Guo, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wxht_2000@163.com; zy.zhang@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,35,5,6,6,59,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Although catch-and-release angling and its effects on nest abandonment have been well documented, very little research has examined the effect that competitive angling practices may have on nest abandonment. We subjected nest-guarding male largemouth bass in one lake and smallmouth bass in four lakes to various competitive angling practices (i.e., livewell retention, release after displacement from the nest, and a combination of these practices) and assessed subsequent nest abandonment. We also examined the importance of nest predation on the nest abandonment decisions of male bass by protecting some of the nests from predation after the angling event. Nest abandonment by largemouth bass was affected by angling treatment, the water depth at the nest site, and brood size but was not affected by male size. Angling treatment and lake influenced abandonment by smallmouth bass guarding eggs, whereas angling treatment, lake, and the presence of a protective nest cover influenced nest abandonment by smallmouth bass guarding fry. The only factor that influenced abandonment for both species and all stages was angling treatment, with abandonment being highest for all treatments that involved prolonged removal and displacement (i.e., the complete tournament simulation). These findings could be important to bass populations if year-class size is related to the number of successful nests. The effects of angling, both catch and release and competitive, on individual nesting success in largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are now well understood, although additional work is needed to determine whether disruption of nesting at the individual level translates to population-level effects.","Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Sect Aquat Ecol & Conservat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Illinois Natural History Survey; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Siepker, MJ (corresponding author), Missouri Dept Conservat, Resource Sci Div, 551 Joe Jones Blvd, W Plains, MO 65775 USA.",Mike.Siepker@mdc.mo.gov,"; Siepker, Michael/O-6042-2019; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659;",,,,,51,19,23,0,27,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Using an observational methodology, we analyzed 971 points from the quarterfinals to the final of the Les Petits As 2023 tournament, a prestigious event for junior players. Data were collected using the OBSTENNIS-JUNIOR-S23 instrument with the LINCE PLUS recording tool and processed with SPSS 25 and THEME 6 Edu software. The findings reveal that the first serve is significantly more effective than the second serve, particularly in short rallies (0-4 shots), where serves directed to the T-zone achieved the highest success rates. U-14 players did not exhibit a dominant serving pattern compared to professional players, distributing their serves relatively evenly across different target areas. Additionally, most players remained in deep baseline positions rather than stepping forward, limiting their ability to capitalize on serve placement. Tactical inefficiencies were evident in the execution of the serve +1 shot, where errors often extended rallies unnecessarily. These findings highlight the need for targeted training interventions to improve serve placement, forward positioning, and decision-making. Implementing these improvements could facilitate a smoother transition to higher levels of play and optimize performance in junior tennis competitions.","[Prieto-Lage, Ivan; Silva-Pinto, Antonio Jose; Gutierrez-Santiago, Alfonso] Univ Vigo, Fac Educ & Sport, Observat Res Grp, Pontevedra 36005, Spain; [Crespo, Miguel] Int Tennis Federat, Dept Dev, London SW15 5XZ, England; [Martinez-Gallego, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Sport & Phys Educ, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Reguera-Lopez-de-la-Osa, Xoana] Inst IIS Galicia Sur, Educ Phys Act & Hlth Res Grp Gies10 DE3, Galicia Hlth Res, SERGAS UVIGO, Vigo 36208, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; University of Valencia,"Prieto-Lage, I (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Fac Educ & Sport, Observat Res Grp, Pontevedra 36005, Spain.;Reguera-López-de-la-Osa, X (corresponding author), Inst IIS Galicia Sur, Educ Phys Act & Hlth Res Grp Gies10 DE3, Galicia Hlth Res, SERGAS UVIGO, Vigo 36208, Spain.",ivanprieto@uvigo.es; miguel.crespo@itftennis.com; rafael.martinez-gallego@uv.es; xreguera@uvigo.es; antoniojose.silva@uvigo.gal; ags@uvigo.es,"Martínez-Gallego, Rafael/ABH-8909-2020; Gutiérrez-Santiago, Alfonso/G-8942-2014; Gutierrez-Santiago, Alfonso/G-8942-2014; Prieto-Lage, Iván/AAG-3472-2019; Crespo, Miguel/N-7315-2019","Martinez-Gallego, Rafael/0000-0002-8849-6463; Prieto-Lage, Ivan/0000-0002-2569-4999; Gutierrez-Santiago, Alfonso/0000-0001-8071-3833;",Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte; European Union; Consejo Superior de Deportes,Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte; European Union(European Union (EU)); Consejo Superior de Deportes,"This study was funded by the Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte (https://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/portada.html (accessed on 20 June 2024)), the Consejo Superior de Deportes (https://www.csd.gob.es/es (accessed on 20 June 2024)), and the European Union (https://european-union.europa.eu/index_es (accessed on 20 June 2024)) under the Project Integracion entre datos observacionales y datos provenientes de sensores externos: Evolucion del software LINCE PLUS y desarrollo de la aplicacion movil para la optimizacion del deporte y la actividad fisica beneficiosa para la salud (2023), EXP_74847, awarded to A.G.-S. and I.P.-L.",,24,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Measures targeted general mental skills used in competitions, golf-specific skills, and competitive trait anxiety. Hierarchical linear regression was utilized to explore the potential moderating role that chronological age may play in influencing the impact of psychological skills and anxiety on competitive tournament performance across the adult life span. Findings suggested no significant age-moderating effects and instead pointed to the importance of developing golf-specific psychological skills to enhance or maintain performance, irrespective of age. Although automaticity (performance feels automatic) predicted performance for all golfers, commitment to the game and confidence in one's putting did so only for the men. These findings reinforce the age-irrelevant role of such skills in fostering the experience of peak performance in a competitive sport context and underscore the importance of interventions targeting older players to help maintain or facilitate the use of psychological skills in helping them manage their games.","[Hayslip, Bert, Jr.; Petrie, Trent A.] Univ N Texas, Dept Psychol, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Hayslip, B (corresponding author), Univ N Texas, Dept Psychol, 1155 Union Circle 311280, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",hayslipb@unt.edu,,,Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology,Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology,This research was supported by a grant from the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology to the authors.,,24,2,3,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1079-5014,1758-5368,,J GERONTOL B-PSYCHOL,J.

Relationships between emotional processes (i.e., appraisal, coping strategies, and emotions) and direction of attention were investigated. Nine male athletes from a senior national team competed in a simulated tournament reproducing the Olympic format. They took part in 13 video-assisted self-confrontation interviews. Using composite sequence qualitative analysis and temporal patterning, the adaptation responses of fencers were depicted. Five situations requiring adaptation emerged: Missing, losing the point, unfavorable referee's decision, breaks and pressure from the opponent. Fencers frequently used combined coping strategies, which often included: rest/stall, acceptance or cognitive restructuring, and strategies requiring heightened attentional effort. A combination of such strategies appeared to favor a focus on strategy or technique. On the other hand, some coping strategies (e.g., rumination, increased physical engagement) and emotions (e.g., unregulated anger) seemed to disrupt attentional focus. Results suggest that in-between points routines and automaticity of coping strategies should be developed. Overall, this study supported that attentional focus and emotional processes are closely intricated constructs. They should be studied jointly to better understand adaptation to competitive situations. They also should be considered conjointly when designing interventions in sports comprising rapidly changing conditions.","[Bracco, M.; Martinent, G.] Univ Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France; [Sondt, N.; Dugeny, S.; Bernier, M.] Univ Brest, Brest, France; [Goisbault, M.; Doron, J.] Nantes Univ, Nantes, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Nantes Universite,"Bracco, M (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lab Vulnerabil & Innovat Sport EA 7428, Villeurbanne, France.",maelle.bracco@univ-lyon1.fr,,"GOISBAULT, Mael/0000-0003-0950-2130; BERNIER, Marjorie/0000-0002-0195-2543",French National Research Agency (ANR); Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-20-STHP-005],French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This study was supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) with a grant from the Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir [ref.

The challenge to studying HPV in hosts is that HPV along with most PVs are both species and tissue restricted. Thus, fundamental properties of HPV viral proteins can be assessed in specialized cell culture systems but host responses that involve innate immunity and host restriction factors requires preclinical surrogate models. Fortunately, there are several well-characterized and new animal models of papillomavirus infections that are available to the PV research community. Old models that continue to have value include canine, bovine and rabbit PV models and new rodent models are in place to better assess host-virus interactions. Questions arise as to the strengths and weaknesses of animal PV models for HPV disease and how accurately these preclinical models predict malignant progression, vaccine efficacy and therapeutic control of HPV-associated disease. In this review, we examine current preclinical models and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the various models as well as provide an update on new opportunities to study the numerous unknowns that persist in the HPV research field.

By conducting in-depth qualitative interviews with 13 community coaches, we explore how f & uacute;tbol, recognised as the world's most popular sport, serves as a space and tool for violence prevention. Our mixed methods study employs qualitative interviews and social network analysis (SNA). The findings reveal that the community's vulnerability, including familial violence and drug use, has detrimental effects on children. Community coaches, positioned as trusted figures, strive to positively influence youth by instilling essential life skills. However, they face challenges such as resource scarcity, limited institutional support and financial difficulties. The coaches express the need to balance adolescents' socioemotional development and the competitive nature of tournaments (olympism).

This transmeridian travel results in a transient desynchronization of the body's circadian rhythms due to a disconnect between the timing of the endogenous circadian oscillator and the external stimuli, manifested as 'jet lag'. While recent reviews highlight the importance of managing jet lag, the time required for resynchronization of the internal clock and dissipation of jet lag symptoms has not yet been summarized. Further, although the literature reports that rapid transmeridian travel is detrimental for athletes' performance, empirical evidence from studies involving athletes is equivocal. Herein, we summarize the evidence that the variability in responses to transmeridian travel can be attributed to differences in (i) travel (real vs. simulated, westbound vs. eastbound, time zones crossed, during normal waking hours vs. normal sleep time), (ii) testing (assessment of performance vs. factors related to performance), and (iii) timing of the testing (destination time vs. 'body time'), and we offer the possibility that differences in (iv) teams, (v) traits, and (vi) tournaments may also be implicated. We focus on (i) aerobic power/endurance, (ii) anaerobic power and capacity, (iii) strength, and (iv) mood state, sleep quantity and quality, and jet lag symptoms in this literature review, which is limited to athletes or physically active participants, travelling west or east crossing four or more time zones.","[Botonis, Petros G.; Toubekis, Argyris G.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Phys Educ & Sport Sci, 41 Ethnikis Antistaseos, Athens 17237, Greece; [Hill, David W.] Univ North Texas, Appl Physiol Lab, Denton, TX USA; [Mundel, Toby] Brock Univ, Dept Kinesiol, St Catharines, ON, Canada",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Brock University,"Botonis, PG (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Phys Educ & Sport Sci, 41 Ethnikis Antistaseos, Athens 17237, Greece.",pboton@phed.uoa.gr,"Toubekis, Argyris/AAD-8371-2019",,Canada Research Chairs Program,Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),"Petros Botonis, Grant/Award Number: EP-REV-2024-091831; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Grant/Award Number: 2023-04492; Canada Research Chairs Programr No Statement Availabler No Statement Available",,91,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0958-0670,1469-445X,,EXP PHYSIOL,Exp.

Design: Single blind, randomised controlled trial with two experimental groups (stretch group: MTPT and stretching; and the ball group: MTPT, a single stretch and medicine ball exercises) and one control group (no intervention). Setting: Professional golf academy. Participants: One hundred, elite, male golfers aged 16-25 years. Main outcome measures: HFL, 3D biomechanical analysis of the golf swing, club head speed (CHS), smash ratio, accuracy and distance at baseline and after the interventions. Results: Backswing hip turn (BSHT) improved in the ball group relative to the control group (p = 0.0248). Accuracy in the ball group and the stretch group improved relative to the control group (Fisher's exact = 0.016). Conclusions: Other performance parameters such as: smash ratio, distance and CHS were not compromised by either intervention. This study advocates the use of MTPT combined with medicine ball exercises over MTPT combined with stretching in the treatment of golfers with shortened hip flexors even immediately preceding a tournament.

There is growing concern about the prevalence of overuse injuries in softball pitchers at all competitive levels. Pitching workload in softball may be a modifiable risk factor and will be discussed in this narrative review. Evidence Acquisition: A review of softball injury research related to workload available in electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, and EBSCO. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Results: There is a paucity of research evaluating workload (inclusive of internal and external risk factors) including pitch counts in women's softball. In particular, research has shown that pitchers report increasing fatigue and pain over a game and weekend tournament, and that the number of pitches thrown by pitchers varies widely. One study showed that pitchers throwing >85 pitches per game had an increased risk of injury over the season. As of 2023, no established pitch count restrictions exist in the United States or Canada. Further research, particularly at high school and collegiate levels, is needed. Conclusion: Softball pitchers are at an increased risk of overuse injury and further research is needed to recommend specific workload interventions such as pitch counts.

The objective was to quantify the effects of successive professional matches on mental fatigue. A total of 14 professional players (9 males, Mage = 25, 5 females, Mage = 21) participated during qualified rounds of a WPT with three eliminatory matches: Match 1 (morning) and 2 (afternoon) on day 1 (n = 14), Match 3 (morning) on day 2 (n = 6). Mental fatigue and motivation, with scales, and reaction time, with a 3-min Psychomotor Vigilance Test, were measured at two time intervals (pre and post matches (<30 min)). To analyze the evolution of these variables, a two-way repeated measures MANOVA was performed. An increase in mental fatigue from pre- to post-matches was observed (p < 0.01), with an accumulation of mental fatigue between matches played on day 1 (p < 0.01), maximizing the mental fatigue perceived during Match 2. Padel matches impair motivation and reaction time (p = 0.04), without effects between successive matches, which reinforced the idea that mental fatigue may impair padel performance (i.e., reaction time). Coaches should use training interventions and recovery strategies to counteract/avoid the accumulation of mental fatigue during professional tournaments.","[Diaz-Garcia, Jesus; Angel Lopez-Gajardo, Miguel; Garcia-Calvo, Tomas] Univ Extremadura, Fac Sport Sci, Caceres 10004, Spain; [Gonzalez-Ponce, Inmaculada] Univ Extremadura, Fac Educ, Badajoz 06006, Spain; [Van Cutsem, Jeroen] Royal Mil Acad, VIPER Res Unit, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Van Cutsem, Jeroen; Roelands, Bart] Vrije Univ Brussel, Human Physiol & Sports Physiotherapy Res Grp, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Roelands, Bart] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Sch Psychol & Life Sci, Sport & Exercise Sci, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England",Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad de Extremadura; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Canterbury Christ Church University,"González-Ponce, I (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Fac Educ, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jdiaz@unex.es; ingopo@unex.es; mianlopezg@gmail.com; jeroen.van.cutsem@vub.be; Bart.Roelands@vub.be; tgarciac@unex.es,"; González Ponce, Inmaculada/L-4841-2014; Roelands, Bart/E-2337-2011; López-Gajardo, Miguel/AAE-5438-2021; Díaz-García, Jesús/AEZ-3454-2022; Garcia-Calvo, Tomas/KXR-0219-2024; García-Calvo, Tomas/KXR-0219-2024; Van Cutsem, Jeroen/AAZ-6281-2021","Lopez Gajardo, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-8364-7632; roelands, bart/0000-0002-2808-044X; Diaz-Garcia, Jesus/0000-0002-9430-750X; Van Cutsem, Jeroen/0000-0001-6122-7629; Garcia-Calvo, Tomas/0000-0002-2550-418X;",Junta de Extremadura (Ministry of Employment and Infrastructure) [GR18102]; Government of Spain (Ministry of Science and Innovation) [FPU18/03660],Junta de Extremadura (Ministry of Employment and Infrastructure); Government of Spain (Ministry of Science and Innovation)(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Assistance to Research Groups (GR18102) of the Junta de Extremadura (Ministry of Employment and Infrastructure); with the contribution of the European Union through the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF).

There are many examples in the US, and the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) for general practitioners (GPs) in the UK is an example of a major system-wide reform. Despite the popularity of these schemes, there is currently little rigorous evidence of their success in improving the quality of primary health care, or of whether such an approach is cost-effective relative to other ways to improve the quality of care. Objectives The aim of this review is to examine the effect of changes in the method and level of payment on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians (PCPs) and to identify: i) the different types of financial incentives that have improved quality; ii) the characteristics of patient populations for whom quality of care has been improved by financial incentives; and iii) the characteristics of PCPs who have responded to financial incentives. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (T h e Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Health STAR, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychLIT, and ECONLIT. Searches of Internet-based economics and health economics working paper collections were also conducted. Finally, studies were identified through the reference lists of retrieved articles, websites of key organisations, and from direct contact with key authors in the field. Articles were included if they were published from 2000 to August 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the impact of different financial interventions on the quality of care delivered by primary healthcare physicians (PCPs). Quality of care was defined as patient reported outcome measures, clinical behaviours, and intermediate clinical and physiological measures. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality, in consultation with two other review authors where there was disagreement. For each included study, we reported the estimated effect sizes and confidence intervals. Main results Seven studies were included in this review. Three of the studies evaluated single-threshold target payments, one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a specified outcome, one study evaluated payments based on the relative ranking of medical groups' performance (tournament-based pay), one study examined amix of tournament-based pay and threshold payments, and one study evaluated changing from a blended payments scheme to salaried payment. Three cluster RCTs examined smoking cessation; one CBA examined patients' assessment of the quality of care; one CBA examined cervical screening, mammography screening, and HbA1c; one ITS focused on four outcomes in diabetes; and one controlled ITS (a difference-in-difference design) examined cervical screening, mammography screening, HbA1c, childhood immunisation, chlamydia screening, and appropriate asthma medication. Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on quality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. One study found no effect on quality of care. Poor study design led to substantial risk of bias in most studies. In particular, none of the studies addressed issues of selection bias as a result of the ability of primary care physicians to select into or out of the incentive scheme or health plan. Authors' conclusions The use of financial incentives to reward PCPs for improving the quality of primary healthcare services is growing. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of financial incentives to improve the quality of primary health care. Implementation should proceed with caution and incentive schemes should be more carefully designed before implementation. In addition to basing incentive design more on theory, there is a large literature discussing experiences with these schemes that can be used to draw out a number of lessons that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify the design of incentive schemes. More rigorous study designs need to be used to account for the selection of physicians into incentive schemes. The use of instrumental variable techniques should be considered to assist with the identification of treatment effects in the presence of selection bias and other sources of unobserved heterogeneity. In randomised trials, care must be taken in using the correct unit of analysis and more attention should be paid to blinding. Studies should also examine the potential unintended consequences of incentive schemes by having a stronger theoretical basis, including a broader range of outcomes, and conducting more extensive subgroup analysis. Studies should more consistently describe i) the type of payment scheme at baseline or in the control group, ii) how payments to medical groups were used and distributed within the groups, and iii) the size of the new payments as a percentage of total revenue. Further research comparing the relative costs and effects of financial incentives with other behaviour change interventions is also required.","[Scott, Anthony; Sivey, Peter; Ouakrim, Driss Ait; Willenberg, Lisa] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia; [Naccarella, Lucio] Univ Melbourne, Australian Hlth Workforce Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia; [Furler, John; Young, Doris] Univ Melbourne, Dept Gen Practice, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Scott, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Level 7,Alan Gilbert Bldg,Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia.",a.scott@unimelb.edu.au,"Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010; Sivey, Peter/V-4668-2019; Furler, John/A-7858-2010","Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378; Sivey, Peter/0000-0002-3703-615X; Furler, John/0000-0003-0339-5848; Ait Ouakrim, Driss/0000-0001-7715-2561","Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, Australia; Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute","Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, Australia; Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute","External sourcesAustralian Primary Health Care Research Institute, Australia.The review was funded by the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute.

This paper presents a single-case study combining different research approaches to monitor the dynamic, idiosyncratic responses to competitive stress in elite sports using the example of professional ballroom dancing. Throughout an 8-month period (313 data points), one international-level female dancer provided data on mood, stress, and fatigue. In parallel, she collected saliva samples for the assessment of cortisol (sCort) and alpha-amylase (sAA). A hair strand was collected every 3 months to examine cumulative cortisol secretion. As expected, perceived stress was related to a reduction in well-being. On a daily basis, sCort predicted lower fatigue. In addition, tournaments resulted in a 3-fold and a 2-fold increase in sCort and sAA, respectively, and there was a pronounced drop in hair cortisol in the aftermath of a surgery-related break from dancing. We confirm competitive ballroom dancing to constitute a major stressor with immediate and prolonged consequences for self-reported well-being and biological stress markers. Single-case studies offer much potential for the observation of complex dynamic associations. In a next step, this approach will also become relevant when evaluating the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic interventions on an individual level.","[Strahler, Jana; Luft, Christina] Univ Marburg, Dept Psychol, Clin Biopsychol, Marburg, Germany; [Strahler, Jana] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol & Sport Sci, Psychotherapy & Syst Neurosci, Giessen, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Strahler, J (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Psychotherapy & Syst Neurosci, Giessen, Germany.",jana.strahler@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Strahler, Jana/AAS-8205-2020","Strahler, Jana/0000-0002-0077-508X",,,,,46,9,9,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7188,1600-0838,,SCAND J MED SCI SPOR,Scand.

The new materials reveal first, Rous's diplomatic practice and the tension between formal and informal diplomacy he pursued; and second, the disquiet in London over North Korean participation, a problem relieved in great part by Rous's interventions. Concerns over anthems, protocol, and flags were mediated by Rous as he negotiated with the British foreign policy-making establishment from his position as FIFA president. The analysis illuminates the negotiation, representation and communication underpinning the diplomacy of the 1966 World Cup. Rous was also influential, though to contrasting effect, in the case of the opposition of the Confederation Africaine de Football (CAF) to apartheid in South Africa and CAF's support for the emerging pan-African cause. The article offers new insights into the diplomatic role of Rous and FIFA and throws light upon the tension between formal and informal diplomatic practices underlying the staging of a global tournament in the 1960s amid the dual pressures of the Cold War and an emerging pan-Africanism.","[Rofe, J.

Design: A prospective 5-month survey of injuries which occurred during competitive amateur boxing and training. Setting: Amateur boxing competitions held in Dublin between November 1992 and March 1993, and the six largest amateur boxing clubs in Dublin. Participants: All the competitors in the tournaments and the >16 year old members of the boxing clubs. Interventions: Participation in competitive amateur bouts and/or boxing training. Main outcome measures: Incidence, pattern, and severity of injuries sustained in competition and training. Results: The incidence of injuries in competition was 0.92 injuries per man-hour of play (or 0.7 injuries per boxer per year), while the incidence in training was 0.69 injuries per boxer per year. Cerebral injuries were reported only in competition, most of these being mild concussion. Hand, wrist and facial injuries were related to direct impact and occurred more frequently in competition than training, while injuries to other body parts were predominantly chronic and training-associated. Shoulder and knee injuries were the most debilitating injuries seen. Conclusions: The yearly risk of injury resulting from participation in amateur boxing is relatively low when compared with other sports, Cerebral injuries, which occur almost exclusively in competition, are predominantly mild concussions.","TRINITY COLL DUBLIN,DEPT ANAT,DUBLIN,IRELAND",Trinity College Dublin,"Porter, M (corresponding author), AUSTRALIAN INST SPORT,DEPT SPORTS MED,POB 176,BELCONNEN,ACT 2616,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,,9,46,51,0,13,LIPPINCOTT-RAVEN PUBL,PHILADELPHIA,"227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106",1050-642X,,,CLIN J SPORT MED,Clin.

Concussion frequently goes unrecognized and unreported in youth hockey. Unintentional injuries among Indigenous youth occur at rates three to four times the national Canadian average. The study sought to examine knowledge, attitudes and sources of concussion information among First Nations people attending a provincial hockey tournament. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken. The survey by Mzazik et al. were modified to use in this study. Participants included youth (6-18 years) hockey players (n = 75), parents (n = 248) and coaches (n = 68). The main outcome measure was total knowledge index (TKI) which consisted of the sum of correct responses to 15 multiple choice questions. Additional data gathered included demographics, concussion history, attitudes toward concussion and sources of information. Descriptive statistics included proportion comparisons. Variables were tested using chi(2) and analysis of variance. Results: Overall TKI scores (out of a total of 15) were low; players (5.9 +/- 2.8), parents (7.5 +/- 2.6) and coaches (7.9 +/- 2.6). Participants with higher knowledge scores reported more appreciation of the seriousness of concussion. Sources of information about concussion differed by study group, suggesting the need for multiple knowledge translation strategies to reach youth, parents and coaches. Conclusions: Future initiatives are urgently needed to improve education and prevention of concussion in First Nations youth hockey. Collaborating and engaging with communities can help to ensure an Indigenous lens for culturally safe interventions.","[Hunt, Cindy; Michalak, Alicja; Lefkimmiatis, Chrissy; Ouchterlony, Donna] St Michaels Hosp, Trauma & Neurosurg Program, Head Injury Clin, 193 Yonge St,3rd Floor, Toronto, ON M5B 1M8, Canada; [Johnston, Elaine] Serpent River First Nation, Cutler, ON, Canada; [Macumber, Leila] Serpent River First Nation, Kenabutch Hlth Ctr, Cutler, ON, Canada; [Jocko, Tony] Union Ontario Indians, North Bay, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto,"Hunt, C (corresponding author), St Michaels Hosp, Trauma & Neurosurg Program, Head Injury Clin, 193 Yonge St,3rd Floor, Toronto, ON M5B 1M8, Canada.",huntci@smh.ca,,,,,,,45,15,16,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0317-1671,2057-0155,,CAN J NEUROL SCI,Can.

Methods: Twenty official matches from the 2023 Super Sevens Championship were analyzed, involving 21 full-time professional athletes (mean age 25.4 +/- 6.0 years) from a single team. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was employed to quantify BIP duration, distance covered per minute, sprint distance per minute (defined as speeds exceeding 18 km/h), and the number of accelerations per minute (above 3.0 m/s2) during both pool stage (n = 12 matches) and knockout stage (n = 8 matches) games. The tournament comprised four events, each featuring three pool matches on the first day and two knockout matches on the second day. Comparisons between the pool stage and knockout stage matches were conducted using Paired Samples T-tests, and effect sizes were reported as Cohen's d. Results: The analysis revealed no significant differences between match types for distance per minute (p = .167; d = 0.544), sprint distance per minute (p = .252; d = 0.442), or accelerations per minute (p = .199; d = 0.502). However, longer BIP durations were observed in the knockout stage matches (difference of 6.1%; p = .022; d = 1.034). Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of tailored training interventions focusing on sustaining performance under fatigue conditions and emphasize the value of analyzing BIP metrics to avoid underestimating match demands.","[Bicudo, Filipe Oliveira; Castro, Henrique de Oliveira] Univ Fed Mato Grosso UFMT, Dept Phys Educ, Cuiaba, Brazil; [Figueiredo, Lucas Savassi] Univ Fed Juiz De Fora, Dept Phys Educ, Campus Avancado Governador Valadares UFJF GV, Governador Valadares, MG, Brazil; [Muller, Camila Borges; da Silva, Amanda Franco] Univ Fed Pelotas UFPel, Escola Super Educ Fis, Pelotas, Brazil; [Pedrosa, Gustavo Ferreira] Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Phys Educ, Santa Maria, Brazil; [Clemente, Filipe Manuel] Inst Politecn Viana Do Castelo, Escola Super Desporto & Lazer, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Clemente, Filipe Manuel] Res Ctr Sports Performance Recreat Innovat & Techn, Melgaco, Portugal; [Clemente, Filipe Manuel] Gdansk Univ Phys Educ & Sport, Dept Biomech & Sport Engn, Gdansk, Poland",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora; Universidade Federal de Pelotas; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Gdansk University of Physical Education & Sport,"Castro, HD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso FEF UFMT, Phys Educ Fac, Phys Educ Dept, Av Fernando Correa Costa 2367, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, Brazil.",henriquecastro88@yahoo.com.br,"Figueiredo, Lucas/AAM-1014-2020; Bicudo, Filipe/LTE-5082-2024; Clemente, Filipe/G-2625-2012","Franco da Silva, Amanda/0000-0002-0729-3454; Pedrosa, Gustavo/0000-0002-9928-4124",,,,,46,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0031-5125,1558-688X,,PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL,Percept.

Although the youngest life stages of these organism are likely to be most affected, a limited number of studies of larval fishes have investigated the effects of combined stressors. We conducted two experiments on larval cobia (Rachycentron canadum) raised under combinations of elevated pCO(2) and increased temperature or starvation stress. Larvae responded to individual CO2, temperature, and rationing treatments, and there was a negative effect of elevated pCO(2) on starvation resistance, but few synergistic effects of combined stressors. Elevated pCO(2) (1700-2100 mu atm pCO(2)) caused a transient but significant reduction in larval standard length (SL), growth rate, and development rate, while warmer temperature (32 vs. 27 degrees C) caused a consistent increase in SL, development rate, and swimming ability. Larval condition (RNA: DNA ratio) was unaffected by elevated pCO(2) although larvae fed a 25% ration had significantly reduced SL, growth rate, and development rate. Under complete feeding cessation, larvae in elevated-pCO(2) seawater demonstrated lower starvation resistance, indicating that acidification may increase starvation risk in a patchy marine environment. Overall, our results indicate that larval cobia are resistant to any major direct impact of combined elevated pCO(2) and temperature or rationing stress.","[Bignami, Sean; Sponaugle, Su; Hauff, Martha; Cowen, Robert K.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bignami, Sean] Concordia Univ, Biol Dept, 1530 Concordia West, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; [Sponaugle, Su] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sponaugle, Su; Hauff, Martha] Stonehill Coll, Biol Dept, Shields Sci Ctr, 320 Washington St, Easton, MA 02357 USA; [Cowen, Robert K.] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA",University of Miami; Concordia University Irvine; Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Bignami, S (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Bignami, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Biol Dept, 1530 Concordia West, Irvine, CA 92612 USA.",sean.bignami@cui.edu,,,National Science Foundation GK-12 program; University of Miami Maytag Ichthyology Chair; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; Manasquan River Marlin and Tuna Club; Yamaha Contender/Miami Billfish Tournament,National Science Foundation GK-12 program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Miami Maytag Ichthyology Chair; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; Manasquan River Marlin and Tuna Club; Yamaha Contender/Miami Billfish Tournament,"All live animal use was conducted with approval of the University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 09-088 ad 2).

HPV-associated diseases and cancers remain a substantial public health and economic burden worldwide despite the availability of prophylactic HPV vaccines. Current diagnosis and treatments for HPV-associated diseases and cancers are predominantly based on cell/tissue morphological examination and/or testing for the presence of high-risk HPV types. There is a lack of robust targets/markers to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatments. Several naturally occurring animal papillomavirus models have been established as surrogates to study HPV pathogenesis. Among them, the Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) model has become known as the gold standard. This model has played a pivotal role in the successful development of vaccines now available to prevent HPV infections. Over the past eighty years, the CRPV model has been widely applied to study HPV carcinogenesis. Taking advantage of a large panel of functional mutant CRPV genomes with distinct, reproducible, and predictable phenotypes, we have gained a deeper understanding of viral-host interaction during tumor progression. In recent years, the application of genome-wide RNA-seq analysis to the CRPV model has allowed us to learn and validate changes that parallel those reported in HPV-associated cancers. In addition, we have established a selection of gene-modified rabbit lines to facilitate mechanistic studies and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In the current review, we summarize some significant findings that have advanced our understanding of HPV pathogenesis and highlight the implication of the development of novel gene-modified rabbits to future mechanistic studies.","[Cladel, Nancy M.; Christensen, Neil D.; Hu, Jiafen] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Cladel, Nancy M.; Christensen, Neil D.; Hu, Jiafen] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Xu, Jie] Univ Michigan, Med Sch, Ctr Adv Models Translat Sci & Therapeut, Med Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Peng, Xuwen] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Comparat Med, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Jiang, Pengfei] Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Inst Mol Virol & Immunol, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China; [Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Zheng, Zhi-Ming] NCI, Tumor Virus RNA Biol Sect, HIV Dynam & Replicat Program, NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Wenzhou Medical University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI),"Hu, J (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.;Hu, J (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",fjh4@psu.edu,"; Zheng, Zhi-Ming/L-6383-2019; peng, xuwen/LLL-2317-2024","Hu, Jiafen/0000-0001-8700-9937; Zheng, Zhi-Ming/0000-0001-5547-7912; Jiang, Pengfei/0000-0001-8996-2406; Xu, Jie/0000-0001-9452-2878","National Cancer Institute [R01 CA47622]; NIH [HHSN272201000020I]; Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine","National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine","This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute under Award Number R01 CA47622 (Christensen), NIH contract HHSN272201000020I (Christensen), the Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament, and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine.",,150,5,5,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4915,,VIRUSES-BASEL,Viruses-Basel,SEP,2022,14,9,,,,,,,1964,10.3390/v14091964,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v14091964,,,15,Virology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Virology,4V6PR,36146770,"Green Published, gold",,,7/25/25,WOS:000859597600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of IPD collected from three large-scale prospective studies, the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) Study, Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS), and Hokuriku Lipid Coronary Heart Disease Study-Pravastatin Atherosclerosis Trial (Holicos-PAT), which compared cardiovascular outcomes with pravastatin therapy and non-statin therapy in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia over a follow-up period of >= 4 years. The incidence of cancer or cancer death in the pravastatin and non-statin therapy groups was compared by multivariate Cox proportional hazard models stratified by trial. Subgroup analyses by sex and age were also conducted using the same methods. Results In a total of 13 724 patients (mean age, 58 years; women, 48%) included in the analyses, pravastatin was not associated with an increased risk of developing cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.81-1.19). Similarly, pravastatin therapy did not statistically affect cancer death (HR, 0.86; 95%CI, 0.61-1.21). Moreover, in subgroups analyses, no influence was observed on cancer incidence or death in relation to sex and age.

We show that 2,100 mu atm partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) significantly increased not only otolith size (up to 49% greater volume and 58% greater relative mass) but also otolith density (6% higher). Estimated relative mass in 800 mu atm pCO(2) treatments was 14% greater, and there was a similar but nonsignificant trend for otolith size. Using a modeling approach, we demonstrate that these changes could affect auditory sensitivity including a similar to 50% increase in hearing range at 2,100 mu atm pCO(2), which may alter the perception of auditory information by larval cobia in a high-CO2 ocean. Our results indicate that ocean acidification has a graded effect on cobia otoliths, with the potential to substantially influence the dispersal, survival, and recruitment of a pelagic fish species. These results have important implications for population maintenance/replenishment, connectivity, and conservation efforts for other valuable fish stocks that are already being deleteriously impacted by overfishing.","[Bignami, Sean; Sponaugle, Su; Cowen, Robert K.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Enochs, Ian C.; Manzello, Derek P.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Enochs, Ian C.; Manzello, Derek P.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Labs, Miami, FL 33149 USA",University of Miami; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML),"Bignami, S (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",sbignami@rsmas.miami.edu,"Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014; Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014","Enochs, Ian/0000-0002-8867-0361;",National Science Foundation GK-12 program; University of Miami Maytag Ichthyology Chair; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; Manasquan River Marlin and Tuna Club; Yamaha Contender/Miami Billfish Tournament,National Science Foundation GK-12 program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Miami Maytag Ichthyology Chair; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; Manasquan River Marlin and Tuna Club; Yamaha Contender/Miami Billfish Tournament,"We thank D.

Cattle ingest toxic plants only when there is food shortage, when they cannot select what they eat, or when they ingest food for preference, which is the case of Hovenia dulcis fruits, very rich in sucrose. This plant is widely distributed in the southern and southeastern Brazilian regions. In literature, there are some cases of severe human liver injury associated with a long-term of IL dulcis leaf and fruit tea intake, and only one report regarding spontaneous poisoning of goats caused by this plant ingestion. However, its toxic effects associated with spontaneous ingestion by cattle have never been reported. This paper reports the first case of spontaneous poisoning in cattle by H. dulcis, which occurred in a dairy farm in southwest Parana, Brazil. Three cattle individuals showed anorexia, ruminal atony, severe diarrhea and neurological tournament, head pressing, blindness. ataxia, and circling. The necropsy of the animals was done, and the remaining alterations were restricted to the digestive system and brain. The clinical signs presented by the animals are characteristic of polioencephalomalacia (PEM), caused by changes in the thiamine metabolism. Furthermore, clinical signs, gross, and microscopic lesions as well as the large amount of the plant throughout the digestive segment led to a diagnosis.","[Bernardi, Fabricio; Possa, Marina Gabriela; Faccin, Mayane; Gruchouskei, Leonardo; Elias, Fabiana] Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Sch Vet Med, BR-85770000 Realeza, PR, Brazil; [Fonseca-Alves, Carlos Eduardo] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Sch Vet Med & Anim Sci, Dept Vet Clin, BR-18618970 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Pipole, Fernando] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Vet Med, Dept Vet Pathol, BR-05508270 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [de Carvalho, Luciana Retz] Inst Bot IBot, Ctr Phycol Res, BR-04301902 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Elias, F (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Sch Vet Med, BR-85770000 Realeza, PR, Brazil.",fabiana.elias@uffs.edu.br,"Fonseca-Alves, Carlos Eduardo/G-7554-2012; Fonseca-Alves, Carlos/G-7554-2012; Carvalho, Luciana/D-8908-2017","Fonseca-Alves, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-6702-6139; Faccin, Mayane/0000-0002-9879-7825",,,,,8,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0049-4747,1573-7438,,TROP ANIM HEALTH PRO,Trop.

Methods This cross-sectional study collected data during the 12th World Karate Championships for cadets, juniors and under-21 athletes (held in Konya, Turkey, 2022). All 1414 registered athletes from 95 countries were invited to complete a 16-item paper-based questionnaire assessing demographic data, concussion history and concussion knowledge prior to the competing at the tournament. chi 2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyse differences by sex, age group and continental karate federation. Results A total of 654 athletes (46.3% response rate), including 286 (43.7%) females and 368 (56.3%) males, participated in the study, with 29.9% reporting one or more concussions during participation in karate training or competition. Older age groups (under 21 years) reported significantly higher concussion rates than younger athletes (56.9% vs 31.1% juniors and 24.7% cadets; p<0.001). Concussion knowledge revealed considerable gaps, with only 24.5% of athletes correctly identifying a concussion and 68.9% believing loss of consciousness was required for a concussion diagnosis. Misconceptions varied significantly across geographical regions, with Asian and African athletes demonstrating the greatest need for targeted education. Female athletes demonstrated better concussion reporting attitudes than males (60.4% vs 48.9%, p=0.004). Conclusions This study highlights the prevalence of concussions and significant knowledge gaps among top-level youth karate athletes, emphasising the need for tailored educational interventions to improve concussion recognition and management within the karate community.","[Augustovicova, Dusana Cierna] Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Sports Sci, Fak telesnej vychovy Sportu, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Augustovicova, Dusana Cierna] Univ Sport Studies, Brno, Czech Republic; [Arriaza, Rafael] Inst Med Arriaza & Asociados, Coruna, Spain; [Arriaza, Rafael] Univ A Coruna, Phys Educ & Sports, La Coruna, Spain; [Lystad, Reidar P.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Comenius University Bratislava; Universidade da Coruna; Macquarie University,"Augustovicova, DC (corresponding author), Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Sports Sci, Fak telesnej vychovy Sportu, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Augustovicova, DC (corresponding author), Univ Sport Studies, Brno, Czech Republic.",augustovicova.dusana@gmail.com; arriazarafael@yahoo.com; reidar.lystad@mq.edu.au,"Augustovičová, Dušana/KHW-3083-2024; Loureda, Rafael/AEY-6558-2022; Lystad, Reidar/D-1611-2013","Lystad, Reidar/0000-0003-0506-0902; Cierna Augustovicova, Dusana/0000-0003-0206-6815; Arriaza, Rafael/0000-0003-1743-3809",,,,,31,0,0,4,4,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",1353-8047,1475-5785,,INJURY PREV,Inj.

Twelve elite tennis players participated in this study. After the familiarization, subjects completed 3 separate randomly sequenced experimental visits, during which 3 different warm-up interventions were performed before the muscle-damaging protocol (12 sets of 30-m maximal repeated sprints): 5 minutes of running (control); control with single leg slide curl (SLC); and control with active hamstring stretching (AHS). Before, immediately (POST0), 1 day (POST1), and 2 days after (POST2) the sprints, hip flexion passive range of motion, hamstring muscle thickness and pennation angle, muscle stiffness, and knee flexion concentric peak torque were measured. Repeated sprints have induced muscle damage in all 3 visits. For AHS, the muscle thickness and stiffness values at POST2 were significantly lower than those of other 2 protocols. In addition, the decrements of concentric strength at POST0, POST1, and POST2 for AHS were also significantly less than those of control and SLC. Therefore, adding a set of dynamic hamstrings stretching to a regular warm-up protocol before repeated sprints has protective effect on the sprinting-induced muscle damage. Athletes whose competitions are densely scheduled (e.g., tennis player in a tournament) may take advantage of this strategy to facilitate muscle recovery from the potential muscle damage, thus, to get maximal recovery for the subsequent competitions.","[Chen, Che-Hsiu] Natl Taiwan Univ Sport, Dept Sport Performance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Ye, Xin] Univ Mississippi, Dept Hlth Exercise Sci & Recreat Management, University, MS 38677 USA; [Wang, Yi-Tse] Univ Taipei, Grad Inst Sports Training, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Yung-Sheng; Tseng, Wei-Chin] Univ Taipei, Dept Exercise & Hlth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Sport; University of Mississippi; University of Taipei; University of Taipei,"Ye, X (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Hlth Exercise Sci & Recreat Management, University, MS 38677 USA.",xye1@olemiss.edu,"; Chen, Trevor/AAV-9964-2020; Ye, Xin/AAC-5032-2019","Chen, Yung-Sheng/0000-0002-1013-3822;",,,,,39,15,15,1,11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1064-8011,1533-4287,,J STRENGTH COND RES,J.

Objective Analysis of the incidence and characteristics of injury in futsal players during top-level international tournaments. Design Prospective survey. Methods Player injuries during three consecutive Futsal World Cups were analysed using an established injury report system. The physicians of all participating teams reported all injuries after each match on a standardised injury report form. The average response rate was 93%. Results A total of 165 injuries were reported from 127 matches, which is equivalent to an incidence of 195.6 injuries per 1000 player hours (95% CI 165.8 to 225.6) or 130.4 injuries per 1000 player matches (95% CI 110.5 to 150.3). The majority of injuries were caused by contact with another player, and 36% of the injuries occurred during non-contact activities. Most injuries affected the lower extremity (70%), followed by head and neck (13%), upper extremity (10%) and trunk (7%). The most frequent diagnoses were contusion of the lower leg (11%), ankle sprain (10%) and groin strain (8%). On average, one time-loss injury in every two matches was reported. Conclusion While the location and diagnosis of injuries were similar in the two types of football, fewer injuries in futsal than in football were caused by contact with another player and by foul play.

We investigated relations among social-contextual factors (e.g., social support), personal motivational factors (e.g., psychological need satisfaction and motivation), young athletes' attitudes toward prosocial (e.g., keeping winning in proportion) and antisocial (e.g., acceptance of cheating and gamesmanship) behaviors, and their actual rule violations during matches in two samples of athletes. Participants in Sample 1 were young team sport athletes (N = 355) and participants in Sample 2 were young male futsal players (N = 296). Athletes in Sample 1 completed validated self-report measures of perceived autonomy support, basic need satisfaction, and autonomous and controlled motivation from self-determination theory, moral attitudes, and past cheating behaviors. Athletes in Sample 2 completed identical measures and two additional behavioral measures: athletes' self-reported number of yellow cards received during competition in the last 6 months and the number of yellow cards athletes received from referees in the subsequent 2 months from competition records. We found significant relations between psychological need satisfaction and self-determined motivation, and athletes' moral attitudes in both samples. These effects held when statistically controlling for past behavior. Importantly, our prospective analysis of Sample 2 indicated that attitudes toward antisocial behaviors predicted athletes' rule violations during subsequent tournament matches. Findings indicate that promoting autonomous motivation and need satisfaction through autonomy support may foster attitudes toward prosocial behaviors, and minimize rule transgressions, in young athletes.","[Mallia, Luca; Zelli, Arnaldo] Univ Rome Foro Italico, Dept Movement Human & Hlth Sci, Largo Lauro de Bosis 5, I-00135 Rome, Italy; [Lucidi, Fabio; Chirico, Andrea] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social & Dev Psychol, Rome, Italy; [Hagger, Martin S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hagger, Martin S.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Sport & Hlth Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Hagger, Martin S.] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Foro Italico University of Rome; Sapienza University Rome; Curtin University; University of Jyvaskyla; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Mallia, L (corresponding author), Univ Rome Foro Italico, Dept Movement Human & Hlth Sci, Largo Lauro de Bosis 5, I-00135 Rome, Italy.",luca.mallia@uniroma4.it,"; Mallia, Luca/N-3708-2015; Hagger, Martin/G-5211-2012","Lucidi, Fabio/0000-0003-2203-9566; Mallia, Luca/0000-0002-8194-8199; Chirico, Andrea/0000-0001-9955-1926",,,,,50,25,33,1,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9029,1559-1816,,J APPL SOC PSYCHOL,J.

This might relate, in part, to obesogenic environments, including recreation food facilities. The REFRESH Study (Recreation Environment and Food Research: Experiences from Hockey) aimed to explore, from the perspectives of adolescent ice hockey players and parents, broad social and physical environmental influences on adolescent food behaviours associated with hockey participation. Design: Players used photovoice to describe their food experiences in relation to ice hockey. The approach included photos, individual interviews and focus groups. Exemplar photographs were exhibited for stakeholders, including five parents who were interviewed. Interview and focus group transcripts were thematically analysed. Setting: Recreational ice hockey environment, Ontario, Canada, 2015-16. Subjects: Ice hockey players (n 24) aged 11-15 years recruited from five leagues. Results: Dominant influences among players included: their perceived importance of nutrients (e.g. protein) or foods (e.g. chocolate milk) for performance and recovery; marketing and branding (e.g. the pro-hockey aura of Tim Horton's((R)), Canada's largest quick-service restaurant); social aspects of tournaments and team meals; and moral values around 'right' and 'wrong' food choices. Both players and parents perceived recreational facility food options as unhealthy and identified that travel and time constraints contributed to less healthy choices. Conclusions: Results indicate recreation facilities are only one of a range of environments that influence eating behaviours of adolescent ice hockey players. Players' susceptibility to advertising/brand promotion and the value of healthy food choices for performance are findings that can inform policy and interventions to support healthy environments and behaviours.","[Caswell, M.

This study was designed to compare the effects produced by three types of protein supplements on body composition, biochemical parameters and performance of a top Brazilian professional soccer team during an actual tournament. Twenty-four athletes assessed as having a normal nutrient intake were divided into three groups according to supplementation. Immediately after each daily training, the athletes received 1 g x kg(-1) of body weight x day(-1) of either whey protein (WP), hydrolyzed whey protein (HWP) or casein (CAS) for eight weeks. Before and after the experimental period, anthropometric characteristics, physical performance by the yo-yo and 3000m tests, and several biochemical variables in blood (uric acid, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, creatinine, glucose) were measured. While no improvement in physical performance was observed with regard to the applied treatments, casein supplementation resulted in muscle mass increase (p<0.039), while WP and HWP favoured the maintenance of the initial muscle mass. Moreover, the eight-week intervention was found to cause no abnormalities in biochemical and anthropometric variables monitored, but instead, the intervention showed to be positive in comparison to the adverse anthropometric changes, when no supplementation was made. It was concluded that supplementation immediately after training sessions with any of the three sources of protein during the competitive period is beneficial and safe, as well as capable of sustaining or even increasing muscle mass.","[Amaya-Farfan, Jaime] Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Food Engn, Prot Sources Lab, Dept Food & Nutr,Sch Food Engn, BR-13083862 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Amaya-Farfan, J (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Food Engn, Prot Sources Lab, Dept Food & Nutr,Sch Food Engn, CP 6121, BR-13083862 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",jaf@fea.unicamp.br,,,CNPq; FAPESP; CAPES,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors wish to acknowledge grants from CNPq and FAPESP and scholarships from both CAPES and CNPq to PCBL, and thank Integralmedica of Sao Paulo for the donation of the milk protein material.",,41,19,22,0,48,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",1640-5544,1899-7562,,J HUM KINET,J.

Rewettability,AGRONOMY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LOCALIZED DRY SPOTS; SOIL; REPELLENCY; FLOW; SURFACTANTS,"Soil water repellency causes non-uniform water infiltration at slow flow rates, which leads to localized dry spot (LDS) on golf course putting greens. Wetting agents are the primary tool used to reduce soil water repellency on golf courses. Field experiments evaluating the efficacy of wetting agents often result in inconsistent conclusions due to variable environmental conditions, management intensity, and level of hydrophobicity. This study used octadecylamine treated sand, which exhibits stable and consistent water repellency, to test the influence of six commercially available wetting agents on water infiltration and sand rewettability. Replicated and repeated experiments were conducted using an infiltration tube system with a 4.4-cm ponding depth (h(o)). Results showed that Cascade Plus, Tournament-Ready, and Hydro-Wet solutions exhibited significantly faster infiltration with steady flow rates at 35 mm min(-1) or more, followed by Revolution and LescoFlo Ultra with a 25 mm min(-1) steady flow rate. All treatments enhanced infiltration, but rewettability varied among tested wetting agents following drying cycles at 55 degrees C until treated sand columns reached a constant weight. After three dry-wet cycles, LescoFlo Ultra treated sand exhibited the best rewettability with a steady flow rate at 34 mm min(-1). In contrast, treatment with Surfside 37 resulted in limited rewettability; water did not infiltrate after the second dry-wet cycle. Results suggest that there are significant differences in infiltration and rewettability among the wetting agents tested in this study. It is advised that specific management needs deserve consideration before selecting the appropriate wetting agent.","[Song, Enzhan; Schneider, Joseph G.; Xiong, Xi] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Anderson, Stephen H.; Goyne, Keith W.] Univ Missouri, Dept Soil Environm & Atmospher Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Xiong, X (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, 108 Waters Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",XiongX@missouri.edu,"Xiong, Xi/JRW-4567-2023",,,,,,35,9,13,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-1962,1435-0645,,AGRON J,Agron.

Design: Retrospective video analysis for acute injuries. Setting: Professional field hockey. Participants: Seven women and men's field hockey tournaments (World League, Champions Trophy) in 2015. Interventions: Not applicable. Outcome Measures: An injury was defined as any new musculoskeletal complaint leading to time stoppage and medical attention. The outcome measures were time at play, location on the pitch, type of injury, injured body part, and injury mechanism. Results: A total of 190 injuries occurred in 179 matches (55/73 female and 135/106 male matches). There were 0.75 injuries per match for women [confidence interval (CI, 0.31-1.13)] and 1.27 injuries per match for men (CI, 0.88-1.61). The number of injuries per 1000 player match hours was 34.20 for women (CI, 14.04-51.29) and 57.89 for men (CI, 29.78-73.12). The highest injury frequency occurred within the third quarter and within the circle. Contusion was the most common injury type (90.9% in women and 96.3% in men). The leading causes of injuries were hits by the ball or stick and collisions with another player. The head/face was the most affected body part in both sex groups (32.7% in women and 29.6% in men). Conclusions: Video analysis revealed data on injury incidence within the same range of previous reports in elite field hockey. Its advantages, such as slow motion and repetitive play of injury scenes, could contribute valuable information if incorporated into the injury recording process.","[Theilen, Till-Martin; Rolle, Udo] Univ Hosp Frankfurt, Dept Paediat Surg & Paediat Urol, Frankfurt, Germany; [Mueller-Eising, Wiebke; Bettink, Peter W.; Rolle, Udo] Federat Int Hockey FIH, Hlth & Safety Panel, Lausanne, Switzerland",Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt Hospital,"Rolle, U (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Frankfurt, FIH Hlth & Safety Panel, Dept Paediat Surg & Paediat Urol, Theodor Stern Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany.",udo.rolle@kgu.de,"Rolle, Udo/AAI-7424-2020","Rolle, Udo/0000-0002-1268-6092",,,,,28,5,5,0,12,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1050-642X,1536-3724,,CLIN J SPORT MED,Clin.

A total of 42 U'12 to U'18 category tennis players, 12 females and 30 males, participated in this cross-sectional study. The players had a mean age of 13.74 (2.07) years old and a national competitive experience of 4.00 (2.14) years. The pre-competitive anxiety of the participants was assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2R (CSAI-2R) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-E) before and after an official tournament's match. Results showed that younger players showed lower trait anxiety (r = 0.333; p < 0.05), lower pre-match state anxiety (r = 0.501; p < 0.01) and lower pre-match somatic anxiety (r = 0.313; p < 0.05). Furthermore, girls exhibited higher values of state anxiety (r = 0.445; p < 0.01) and somatic anxiety (r = 0.440; p < 0.01) than boys before the match. However, differences were not observed in the trait anxiety measured by STAI-E (r = 0.203; p = 0.213), cognitive anxiety (r = 0.140; p = 0.363), and self-confidence measured by the CSAI questionnaire (r = 0.150; p = 0.333), before the match. Therefore, coaches and sport psychologists should implement adequate on- and off-court individualized interventions to manage anxiety, specifically in girls and players over 14 years old. Although anxiety levels were similar to those before the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the influence of the pandemic on mental health, results might be taken with caution.","[Martinez-Gallego, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Sport & Phys Educ, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Villafaina, Santos; Pedro Fuentes-Garcia, Juan] Univ Extremadura, Fac Sports Sci, Avda Univ S-N, Caceres 10003, Spain; [Villafaina, Santos] Univ Evora, Sch Hlth & Human Dev, Dept Sport & Hlth, P-7004516 Evora, Portugal; [Crespo, Miguel] Int Tennis Federat, Dev Dept, London SW15 5XZ, England",University of Valencia; Universidad de Extremadura; University of Evora,"Crespo, M (corresponding author), Int Tennis Federat, Dev Dept, London SW15 5XZ, England.",rafael.martinez-gallego@uv.es; svillafaina@unex.es; miguel.crespo@itftennis.com; jpfuent@unex.es,"Martínez-Gallego, Rafael/ABH-8909-2020; Villafaina, Santos/R-4566-2019; Crespo Celda, Miguel/E-4059-2019; Fuentes García, Juan Pedro/L-1540-2018; Crespo, Miguel/N-7315-2019; Fuentes Garcia, Juan Pedro/L-1540-2018","Martinez-Gallego, Rafael/0000-0002-8849-6463; Villafaina, Santos/0000-0003-0784-1753; Crespo Celda, Miguel/0000-0001-7952-7603; Fuentes Garcia, Juan Pedro/0000-0002-8299-1092",Department of Economy and Infrastructure of the Junta de Extremadura through the European Regional Development Fund.

Faults and diseases of the eye and its adnexa that reduce the value of the horse should be identified. The decrease in value may be estimated differently, depending on the main use of the horse. In sport horses a disorder of vision caused by an injury may strongly reduce the animal's value. It may even lead to complete sport incapability. In contrast, a congenital disease of the eye could well have no influence on the use in equine sports. On the other hand a breeding horse showing congenital disease of the eye will significantly decrease in value, but will not do so by suffering from an injury-caused disorder of vision. With chronic diseases the costs of repeated treatments should furthermore be considered, as well as tournament cancellation due to start-restrictions after administration of doping-relevant drugs. It is recommended to keep to a fixed scheme while examining the eye, going from the outside to the inside and to keep records of all observed alterations. First the eyes and its adnexa as well as the surrounding of the eyes are inspected in bright room light. Then the eyeball is examined in a dark surrounding. The anterior part of the eye is observed with a magnifying glass while lighted from the side. After the assessment of the pupil and its reflex, the posterior part of the eye is examined with focal light, an ophthalmoscope and a slit-lamp. If necessary, a mydriatic agent is administered.

Identifying patients at risk for PPCS soon after an injury can provide useful clinical information. Purpose: To determine if the Predicting Persistent Post-concussive Problems in Pediatrics (5P) clinical risk score, an emergency department (ED)-derived and validated tool, is associated with developing PPCS when obtained in a primary care sports concussion setting. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We conducted a study of patients seen at a pediatric sports medicine concussion clinic between May 1, 2013, and October 1, 2017, who were <19 years of age and evaluated within 10 days of a concussion. The main outcome was PPCS, defined as symptoms lasting >28 days. Nine variables were used to calculate the 5P clinical risk score, and we assessed the association between the 5P clinical risk score and PPCS occurrence. The secondary outcome was total symptom duration. Results: We examined data from 230 children (mean age, 14.8 +/- 2.5 years; 50% female; mean time from injury to clinical assessment, 5.6 +/- 2.7 days). In univariable analyses, a greater proportion of those who developed PPCS reported feeling slowed down (72% vs 44%, respectively; P < .001), headache (94% vs 72%, respectively; P < .001), sensitivity to noise (71% vs 43%, respectively; P < .001), and fatigue (82% vs 51%, respectively; P < .001) and committed >= 4 errors in tandem stance (33% vs 7%, respectively; P < .001) than those who did not. Higher 5P clinical risk scores were associated with increased odds of developing PPCS (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62 [95% CI, 1.30-2.02]) and longer symptom resolution times (beta = 8.40 [95% CI, 3.25-13.50]). Among the individual participants who received a high 5P clinical risk score (9-12), the majority (82%) went on to experience PPCS. The area under the curve for the 5P clinical risk score was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.84). After adjusting for the effect of covariates, fatigue (adjusted OR, 2.93) and >= 4 errors in tandem stance (adjusted OR, 7.40) were independently associated with PPCS. Conclusion: Our findings extend the potential use for an ED-derived clinical risk score for predicting the PPCS risk into the sports concussion clinic setting. While not all 9 predictor variables of the 5P clinical risk score were independently associated with the PPCS risk in univariable or multivariable analyses, the combination of factors used to calculate the 5P clinical risk score was significantly associated with the odds of developing PPCS. Thus, obtaining clinically pragmatic risk scores soon after a concussion may be useful for early treatments or interventions to mitigate the PPCS risk.","[Howell, David R.; Zemek, Roger; Brilliant, Anna N.; Mannix, Rebekah C.; Master, Christina L.; Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Sports Concuss Clin, Boston, MA USA; [Howell, David R.] Childrens Hosp Colorado, Ctr Sports Med, 13123 East 16th Ave,B060, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Howell, David R.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped, Aurora, CO USA; [Howell, David R.; Brilliant, Anna N.; Meehan, William P., III] Micheli Ctr Sports Injury Prevent, Waltham, MA USA; [Zemek, Roger] Univ Ottawa, Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Dept Pediat, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Brilliant, Anna N.; Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Sports Med, Boston, MA USA; [Mannix, Rebekah C.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Emergency Med, Boston, MA USA; [Mannix, Rebekah C.; Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA USA; [Master, Christina L.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sports Med & Performance Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Master, Christina L.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Ottawa; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania,"Howell, DR (corresponding author), Childrens Hosp Colorado, Ctr Sports Med, 13123 East 16th Ave,B060, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",David.Howell@ucdenver.edu,"Zemek, Roger/H-1039-2018; Mannix, Rebekah/AAD-8702-2020","Mannix, Rebekah/0000-0003-3608-2792; Master, Christina/0000-0002-6717-4270",National Hockey League Alumni Association through the Corey C.

Methods This prospective cohort study included all international attendees. All participants required a minimum of one negative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) test prior to travelling to each tournament. High-risk contacts were isolated for 10 days. Moderate-risk contacts received education regarding enhanced medical surveillance, had daily rapid antigen testing for 5 days, with RT-PCR day 5, mandated mask use and access to outside space for work purposes only. Low-risk contacts received rapid antigen testing every 48 hours and PCR testing on day 5. Results A total of 550 persons were accredited and were required to undergo RT-PCR testing before the event. Two of these tests were positive (0.36%). Of these, case 1 had 1 high, 23 moderate and 48 low-risk contacts. Case 2 did not have any significant travel history within 2 days of positive test and had one high-risk contact. There were no further positive tests on site in the wider cohort of attendees, from a total of 872 RT-PCR and 198 rapid antigen tests. Conclusions This pilot study showed it is practical, feasible and well accepted to provide enhanced (daily) virus testing and risk-mitigating measures at a professional golf event. Further study is required to assess the efficacy of these interventions; however, no transmission was found in this pilot study.","[Robinson, Patrick G.] Royal Infirm Edinburgh NHS Trust, Edinburgh Orthopaed, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Robinson, Patrick G.; Murray, Andrew; Sheer, Volker; Close, Graeme] European Tour Performance Inst, Virginia Water, England; [Murray, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Phys Act Hlth Res Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Murray, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Sport & Exercise, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sheer, Volker] Univ Distancia Madrid UDIMA, Hlth Sci Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Sheer, Volker] Ultra Sports Sci Fdn, Pierre Benite, France; [Close, Graeme] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Res Inst Sport & Exercise Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Kinane, Denis F.] Univ Bern, Sch Dent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Kinane, Denis F.] Cignpost Diagnost, Med & Sci Dept, Farnborough, Hants, England","Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; Madrid Open University, UDIMA; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Bern","Robinson, PG (corresponding author), Royal Infirm Edinburgh NHS Trust, Edinburgh Orthopaed, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",patrick.robinson321@gmail.com,"; Close, graeme/I-7287-2012","Robinson, Patrick/0000-0002-8117-2968;",,,,,31,7,7,0,5,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",2398-9459,2055-7647,,BMJ OPEN SPORT EXERC,BMJ Open Sport Exerc.

The purpose of this study was to develop a classification algorithm based on unsupervised cluster analysis, identifying clusters that represent clinically relevant asthma phenotypes that may share asthma-related outcomes.Methods: We performed a multicentre prospective cohort study, including adult patients with asthma (N = 512) from the MEGA study (Mechanisms underlying the Genesis and evolution of Asthma). A stan-dardised clinical history was completed for each patient. Cluster analysis was performed using the kernel k-groups algorithm. Results: Four clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (31.5% of subjects) includes adult-onset atopic patients with better lung function, lower BMI, good asthma control, low ICS dose, and few exacerbations. Cluster 2 (23.6%) is made of adolescent-onset atopic asthma patients with normal lung function, but low adherence to treatment (59% well-controlled) and smokers (48%). Cluster 3 (17.1%) includes adult-onset patients, mostly severe non-atopic, with overweight, the worse lung function and asthma control, and receiving combination of treatments. Cluster 4 (26.7%) consists of the elderly-onset patients, mostly female, atopic (64%), with high BMI and normal lung function, prevalence of smokers and comorbidities. Conclusion: We defined four phenotypes of asthma using unsupervised cluster analysis.

All four HPV types tested bind to a component(s) of the ECM. HPV11 VLP binding is blocked when the ECM is pretreated with an anti-laminin 5 (LN5) polyclonal antibody. A series of treatments utilizing heparins and heparinase revealed that HPV18 VLPs are dependent on heparan sulfates (HS) for binding to cells and ECM. HPV16 and HPV45 VLPs are dependent on HS for binding to HaCaT cells and dependent on both HIS and LN5 for binding to ECM. These studies emphasize the need to study the binding characteristics of different HPV types before applying universal binding principles to all papillomaviruses.","[Broutian, Tatevik R.; Brendle, Sarah A.; Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Canc Res Fdn, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Broutian, Tatevik R.; Brendle, Sarah A.; Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Broutian, Tatevik R.; Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health,"Christensen, ND (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Canc Res Fdn, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",ndc1@psu.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1-CA47622, CA40145]; Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament",National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament,"We would like to thank T.

The objective of this study was to establish a 3-year risk prediction model for cardiovascular disease based on data from 13 052 patients with no history of cardiovascular disease in the Olmesartan Mega study to determine the relationship between Cardiovascular Endpoints and Blood Pressure Goal Achievement study. To develop dynamic prediction models including on-treatment blood pressure, a Cox proportional hazard model using the sliding landmarking method with three landmark points (6, 12 and 18 months from baseline) was used. The prediction model included blood pressure (<130/85mmHg, >= 130/85 to <140/90mmHg, >= 140/90 to <160/100mmHg and >= 160/100mmHg) as a time-dependent covariate and well-known baseline risk factors (sex, age, smoking, family history of coronary artery disease and diabetes) as covariates. The 3-year risk assessment chart was constructed using the combination of all risk factors in the prediction model, and six different colors were displayed on each chart corresponding to the predicted probability of cardiovascular disease. Judging from the chart, if an elderly man with diabetes and other risk factors had a blood pressure of <130/85mmHg at 6 months, the risk of cardiovascular disease would be 8.0%, whereas the risk would be 8.6% if he had a blood pressure of >= 130/85 to <140/90mmHg. The risk assessment chart developed from the large-scale observational study data would help physicians to more easily assess the cardiovascular disease risk for hypertensive patients on antihypertensive treatments.","[Teramukai, Satoshi] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Biostat, 465 Kajii Cho,Kawaramachi Hirokoji, Kyoto, Japan; [Okuda, Yasuyuki; Shirayama, Masayuki] Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Miyazaki, Shigeru] Shin Yamanote Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Kawamori, Ryuzo] Juntendo Univ, Grad Sch Med, Sportol Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Teramoto, Tamio] Teikyo Univ, Teikyo Acad Res Ctr, Tokyo 173, Japan",Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine; Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited; Juntendo University; Teikyo University,"Teramukai, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Biostat, 465 Kajii Cho,Kawaramachi Hirokoji, Kyoto, Japan.",steramu@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp,"Teramukai, Satoshi/I-2249-2019","Teramukai, Satoshi/0000-0003-2184-0597","Daiichi (Tokyo, Japan)","Daiichi (Tokyo, Japan)(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited)","We are grateful to the patients, physicians and medical staff who participated in the OMEGA study and thank their co-workers for their support of the OMEGA study.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Youth sport athletic tournaments, competitions, and practices. Patients or Other Participants: Parents (n = 1000, 614 women, age: 44.5 +/- 6.7 years) of youth athletes completed the survey. Parents had to have a child between 10 and 18 years of age who participated in organized sport in the previous 12 months. Interventions: The survey was anonymous and consisted of yes/no and Likert-scale questions and consisted of background of parent and child and perceptions and knowledge of safe sport recommendations. An expert panel validated the survey. Main Outcome Measures: Data were summarized by frequencies, proportions (%), and mean values and SDs, when appropriate. Chi-square analyses were used to determine if parent sex influenced distributions. Results: Over 80% of parents had no knowledge of sport volume recommendations regarding h/wk (84.5%), mo/yr (82.2%), or simultaneous participation in multiple leagues (89.9%). Twenty-four percent of parents considered it appropriate to participate in multiple leagues in the same sport, whereas 60.5% considered it appropriate to participate in multiple leagues of a different sport. Thirty-four percent of parents indicated that they were concerned about the risk of injury in youth sports. Although 55% of parents considered sport specialization a problem in youth sports, only 43.3% thought that year-round sport participation increased the chances of sustaining an overuse injury. Female parents were more likely to be concerned about injury and believe that year-round sport participation results in overuse injury compared with men. Conclusions: Recommendations associated with youth sport participation are not well known. However, parents are concerned about the risk of injury and consider sport specialization a problem.","[Bell, David R.; Post, Eric G.; Schaefer, Daniel A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Kinesiol, Madison, WI USA; [Bell, David R.; Post, Eric G.; Schaefer, Daniel A.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Injury Sport Lab, Madison, WI USA; [Bell, David R.; McGuine, Timothy A.; Brooks, Margaret Alison] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Orthoped & Rehabil, Madison, WI USA; [Trigsted, Stephanie M.] High Point Univ, High Point, NC USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bell, DR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, 2000 Observ Dr,2031 Gymnasium Natatorium, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",drbell2@wisc.edu,"Post, Eric/KFA-6136-2024",,American Medical Society for Sports Medicine; American College of Sports Medicine,American Medical Society for Sports Medicine; American College of Sports Medicine,Supported by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American College of Sports Medicine.,,16,28,34,0,9,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1050-642X,1536-3724,,CLIN J SPORT MED,Clin.

Results, During match play blood glucose (GLU) was higher in CHO and did not differ between CAF and PLA, Immediately after the resting period GLU temporary declined in CHO and PLA, while no significant changes occured in CAF, Increases of serum FFA and glycerol as well as the decrease of insulin were similar during the PLA and CAF trials and less pronounced in CHO. Postexercise urine concentrations of epinephrine and caffeine were significantly higher in CAF, Perception ratings and hitting accuracy (BMT) were not affected by treatment. CHO resulted in higher blood lactate levels during match play and a better postexercise sprint performance (TST). Under CAF women won significantly more games than during both other treatments, Conclusions. CHO enhances tennis-specific running-speed but has no ergogenic effect on tennis performance under the conditions of our study, CAF improves glucose homeostasis at the beginning of work load after rest and may increase tennis success in women.","German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Sport Games, D-50933 Cologne, Germany",German Sport University Cologne,"Ferrauti, A (corresponding author), German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Sport Games, Carl Diem Weg 6, D-50933 Cologne, Germany.",,"Ferrauti, Alexander/P-9577-2019","Alexander, Ferrauti/0000-0001-9807-2755",,,,,46,39,44,0,16,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0022-4707,,,J SPORT MED PHYS FIT,J.

In Uganda, despite health education and sensitisation efforts through communication campaigns by the Ministry of Health to reduce schistosomiasis prevalence, common risky practices still pose a challenge, especially among endemic communities. Here, we steered away from the conventional top-down approach to communication campaigns and explored alternative methods. We employed citizen science (CS) and other participatory action research (PAR) techniques as a bottom-up approach to co-design and implement a communication campaign among communities of western Uganda, to achieve a more tangible outcome of behaviour change for preventing schistosomiasis. We collected qualitative data using data party, world cafe, prioritisation and ranking, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews from 378 purposively selected individuals and analysed it using a thematic analysis model. Community volunteers, community radios and local leaders were the most preferred channels for passing schistosomiasis information identified by participants. Lack of access to safe water and healthcare services, open defecation, and inadequate knowledge of schistosomiasis are some of the most pressing problems prioritised. Door-to-door visits by citizen scientists (CSs), community meetings, drama, and tournaments were the channels proposed by CSs and community groups during the co-design workshops. Over 1000 households and about 9000 community members were directly reached using the channels. Endemic communities prefer receiving schistosomiasis information using local channels instead of conventional ones. Combining citizen science with other PAR approaches empowers communities to interpret research findings in their contexts and take charge of the interventions. As such, clear and simple message coverage and a high audience turn-up can be achieved. A follow-up study is needed to evaluate the process and impact of the communication intervention on the citizen scientists and the community's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding preventive measures.","[Anyolitho, Maxson Kenneth] Lira Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, Lira, Uganda; [Anyolitho, Maxson Kenneth; Nyakato, Viola Nilah] Mbarara Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Interdisciplinary Studies, Dept Human Dev & Relat Sci, Mbarara, Uganda; [Anyolitho, Maxson Kenneth; Masquillier, Caroline] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Huyse, Tine] Royal Museum Cent Afr, Dept Biol, Tervuren, Belgium; [Masquillier, Caroline] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Family Med & Populat Hlth FAMPOP, Antwerp, Belgium; [Masquillier, Caroline] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Family Populat & Hlth, Antwerp, Belgium; [Poels, Karolien] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium",Lira University; Mbarara University of Science & Technology; University of Antwerp; Royal Museum for Central Africa; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Anyolitho, MK (corresponding author), Lira Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, Lira, Uganda.;Anyolitho, MK (corresponding author), Mbarara Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Interdisciplinary Studies, Dept Human Dev & Relat Sci, Mbarara, Uganda.;Anyolitho, MK (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Antwerp, Belgium.",manyolitho@lirauni.ac.ug,"; Poels, Karolien/AAT-3647-2021; Kenneth Anyolitho, Maxson/AAP-5207-2021","Huyse, Tine/0000-0001-8164-9757; Anyolitho, Maxson Kenneth/0000-0003-1421-1178;",Belgian Development Cooperation program; Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA); Directorate-General of Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid; Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda; RMCA,Belgian Development Cooperation program; Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA); Directorate-General of Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid; Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda; RMCA,"We would like to thank the ATRAP project team: Dr. Casim Umba Tolo, Associate Professor Grace Rugunda Kagoro, Julius Tumusiime, Faith Mugabi, Daisy Namirembe and Noelia Valderrama.

However, particular aspects regarding management of weight category comparing three sport disciplines remain to be investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to obtain information regarding the weight loss strategies that competitors performed before a tournament. Materials and Methods: This article describes the most common dietary-nutritional strategies used by 140 national university male competitors of judo (n = 52), karate (n = 40) and taekwondo (n = 48) in order to achieve a specific weight, according to the rapid weight loss questionnaire (RWLQ) and the EAT-27 questionnaire. Results: Around 50% of participants were not involved in a weight loss process. Among the remaining participants, we considered three periods for weight reduction: less than 1 week (35% in judo, 8% in karate and 19% in taekwondo), less than 1 month (17% in judo, 15% in karate and 26% in taekwondo) and more than 1 month (0% in judo, 5% in karate and 21% in taekwondo). Severe fasting, focused on food/water restriction, was the most commonly used strategy, being more frequent in judo players. Light weight judo practitioners generally lost 2-5 kg before the contest. One third of participants avoided carbohydrate consumption when performing food restriction. Finally, individuals that reduced weight in the last week seemed to develop an unhealthy psychological relationship with food. Conclusion: All these aspects could be particularly relevant, providing information regarding how competitors manage basic nutritional concepts that guide dieting strategies. This information is relevant to prepare future educational interventions in the area of nutrition for competitors, coaches and technical staff.","[Martinez-Rodriguez, Alejandro] Univ Alicante, Fac Sci, Dept Analyt Chem Nutr & Food Sci, Alicante 03609, Spain; [Martinez-Rodriguez, Alejandro; Vicente-Salar, Nestor; Roche, Enrique] Alicante Inst Hlth & Biomed Res ISABIAL, Alicante 03010, Spain; [Vicente-Salar, Nestor; Roche, Enrique] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Inst Bioengn, Dept Appl Biol Nutr, Elche 03202, Spain; [Montero-Carretero, Carlos; Cervello-Gimeno, Eduardo] Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Sport Sci, Sport Res Ctr, Elche 03202, Spain; [Roche, Enrique] Inst Salud Carlos III ISCIII, CIBER Fisiopatol Obesidad & Nutr CIBEROBN, Madrid 28029, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; General University Hospital of Alicante; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universitat d'Alacant; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria y Biomedica de Alicante (ISABIAL); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEROBN,"Roche, E (corresponding author), Alicante Inst Hlth & Biomed Res ISABIAL, Alicante 03010, Spain.;Roche, E (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Inst Bioengn, Dept Appl Biol Nutr, Elche 03202, Spain.;Roche, E (corresponding author), Inst Salud Carlos III ISCIII, CIBER Fisiopatol Obesidad & Nutr CIBEROBN, Madrid 28029, Spain.",amartinezrodriguez@gcloud.ua.es; nvicente@umh.es; cmontero@umh.es; ecervello@umh.es; eroche@umh.es,"; Vicente-Salar, Néstor/AAL-9651-2020; cervello, eduardo/ABC-5973-2020; Montero-Carretero, Carlos/ABI-6748-2020; Roche, Enrique/V-5738-2017; Martínez-Rodríguez, Alejandro/AAK-5669-2020","del Pino Ortega, Daniel/0000-0001-5051-9482; Montero, Carlos/0000-0002-1565-8169; Vicente-Salar, Nestor/0000-0003-2276-7205; Martinez-Rodriguez, Alejandro/0000-0002-7499-1471; Roche, Enrique/0000-0001-5128-1672;","ISABIAL [190290]; Official Funding Agency for Biomedical Research of the Spanish Government, Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII) through CIBEROBN - European Regional Development Fund [CB12/03/30038]","ISABIAL; Official Funding Agency for Biomedical Research of the Spanish Government, Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII) through CIBEROBN - European Regional Development Fund","This study was supported by ISABIAL (grant number 190290) and the Official Funding Agency for Biomedical Research of the Spanish Government, Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII) through CIBEROBN (CB12/03/30038), which is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.",,28,7,9,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1010-660X,1648-9144,,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,Med.

Game activity and blood lactate in men's elite water-polo players. J Strength Cond Res 24(10): 2647-2651, 2010-The purpose of this study was to examine game demands during highly competitive men's water-polo games after the introduction of the new Federation International Natation Association (FINA) rules. Participants of this study were 77 outfield international level men's water-polo players (age 25.9 +/- 4.5 years, height 188 +/- 4.5 cm, body mass 93 +/- 10.9 kg). Game earlobe blood lactate, speed, and distance covered (semiautomatic image recognition system) were measured during 6 highly competitive matches (FINA International Tournament). In the game, players covered 1,613 +/- 150 m (n = 68). This corresponds to a mean coverage rate of 54 +/- 5.8 m.min(-1) (n = 68). At speeds faster than 1.4 m.s(-1) (high-intensity swimming), players covered 44% of the total distance. A significant decrease in coverage rate was detected during the final stage of the game. Mean blood-lactate concentration was 7.7 +/- 1.0 mmol.L-1 (range 2.2-14.3). Center Defenders (1,816 +/- 496 m) covered significantly (p<0.05) more distance swimming compared to Field (1,676 +/- 348 m) and Center-Forward (1,317 +/- 281 m) players. Mean match blood-lactate concentrations for Center Forwards, Center Defenders, and Field Players were 11.2 +/- 1.0 (3-14.3), 6.7 +/- 0.9 (1.4-8), and 5.3 +/- 0.9 mmol.L-1 (2.2-11.9), respectively. This study confirmed the high-intensity nature of male elite level water polo showing remarkable role-dependent game demands. As a result, strength and conditioning interventions should be individualized and mainly address intermittent high-intensity endurance and anaerobic fitness.","[Melchiorri, Giovanni; Castagna, Carlo; Sorge, Roberto] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Sch Sport & Exercise Sci, Fac Med & Surg, Rome, Italy; [Melchiorri, Giovanni] Fdn Don C Gnocchi, Rome, Italy; [Bonifazi, Marco] Univ Siena, Dept Human Physiol, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus; University of Siena,"Castagna, C (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Sch Sport & Exercise Sci, Fac Med & Surg, Rome, Italy.",castagnac@libero.it,"; Castagna, Carlo/IUO-8194-2023","MELCHIORRI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-7671-3651; Castagna, Carlo/0000-0002-8320-6404; Bonifazi, Marco/0000-0001-6937-9109",,,,,24,51,53,0,9,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1064-8011,1533-4287,,J STRENGTH COND RES,J.

A transactional perspective of psychological responses over time was used to guide data analysis. The ambient mood is proposed to contribute to the interpretation of, and reaction to, events during competition, which lead to subsequent emotional responses. A male international Judo player completed a number of self-report measures before and during a 4-contest tournament. Measures included the EPQ, MCOPE, Brunel Mood Scale, self-set goals, and self-efficacy for goal attainment. State measures were completed after every contest. Results indicated high scores of self-efficacy to achieve performance goals and outcome goals. Pre-competition mood results indicated high scores on the Vigor and Anger subscales with moderate scores for Tension, and zero scores for Depressed mood, a mood profile that remained relatively stable after winning his first two contests. After losing his third contest, he reported symptoms of Depressed mood and indicated using self-blame as coping strategy during the contest. Before the fourth contest, he coped by using planning and increasing effort. These coping strategies were associated with reductions in Depressed mood and increases in Vigor. After finding out his next contest was against a former World Championship bronze medalist, self-set goals became performance and process with no outcome goal. On losing this contest, scores on the Anger and Depression subscales increased sharply, Fatigue scores increased slightly and Tension and Vigor reduced. Self-blame was used as a coping strategy when experiencing unpleasant emotions. Findings suggest that self-blame was associated with negative psychological states comprising depressed mood. Increasing effort and planning were associated with positive psychological states. Collectively, findings emphasize the value of using a transactional design to explore mood changes over time, and future research should investigate the effectiveness of applied interventions.","Wolverhampton Univ, Sch Sport Performing Arts & Leisure, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England; Univ So Queensland, Dept Psychol, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University of Wolverhampton; University of Southern Queensland,"Stevens, MJ (corresponding author), Capital City Acad, Doyle Gardens, London NW10 3ST, England.",MattJStevens@btinternet.com; A.M.Lane2@wlv.ac.uk; terryp@usq.edu.au,"Lane, Andrew/AAV-4179-2020; Terry, Peter/KBC-0364-2024","Terry, Peter/0000-0002-7018-4533",,,,,38,19,20,0,20,JOURNAL SPORTS SCIENCE & MEDICINE,BURSA,"MEDICAL FACULTY ULUDAG UNIV, DEPT SPORTS MEDICINE, BURSA, 16059, TURKEY",1303-2968,,,J SPORT SCI MED,J.

Messages using behavioral science principles may increase vaccination rates. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect on influenza vaccination rates of a text message telling patients that an influenza vaccine had been reserved for them. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS As part of a larger influenza vaccine messaging megastudy, in this randomized clinical trial, 11188 patients in 2 large health systems were assigned to receive a text message that stated a flu shot has been reserved for you, a text message that stated flu shots will be available, or no text message. Both messages included the option to reply yes (Y) or no (N) to indicate that the patient wanted to get vaccinated. Patients 18 years or older were included if they had new or routine (nonsick) primary care appointments scheduled from September 20, 2020, through March 31. 2021. INTERVENTIONS The evening before the scheduled appointment, patients in the 2 message conditions were sent 3 back-to-back SMS messages containing the study wording. Patients in the usual care control group did not receive any study messages. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Receipt of an influenza vaccine on the date of the patient's scheduled appointment. RESULTS A total of 11188 patients were randomized to the reserved or the available message conditions or to usual care. The 10 158 patients analyzed in the study had a mean (SD) age of 50.61 (16.28) years; 5631(55.43%) were women; and 7025 (69.16%) were White. According to health records, 4113 (40.49%) had been vaccinated in the previous influenza season, and 5420 (53.36%) were patients at Penn Medicine. In an intent-to-treat analysis, changes in vaccination rates in response to the reserved message did not reach statistical significance (increase of 1.4 percentage points, or 4% [P = .31]) compared with the message conveying that influenza vaccines were available. Relative to the usual care control, the reserved message increased vaccination rates by 3.3 percentage points, or 11% (P = .004). Patients in the reserved message condition were more likely to text back Y (1063 of 3375 [31.50%]) compared with those in the available message condition (887 of 3351[26.47%]; chi(2) = 20.64; P < .001), and those who replied Y were more likely to get vaccinated (1532 of 1950 [78.56%]) compared with those who did not (749 of 4776 [15.68%]; chi(2) = 2400; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that patients who received text messages regarding flu vaccination had greater vaccine uptake than those who received no message. Messages that increase the likelihood that patients will indicate their intention to be vaccinated may also increase vaccination behavior.","[Buttenheim, Alison] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Dept Family & Community Hlth, 418 Curie Blvd,416 Fagin Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Milkman, Katherine L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gromet, Dena M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Behav Change Good Initiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Patel, Mitesh] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chapman, Gretchen] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Carnegie Mellon University,"Buttenheim, A (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Dept Family & Community Hlth, 418 Curie Blvd,416 Fagin Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",abutt@nursing.upenn.edu,"Milkman, Katherine/LEL-9898-2024; Duckworth, Angela/AFK-9545-2022",,NIA/NIH [P30AG034532]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Penn Center for Precision Medicine Accelerator Fund; AKO Foundation; Flu Lab,NIA/NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Penn Center for Precision Medicine Accelerator Fund; AKO Foundation; Flu Lab,"This study was supported by award P30AG034532 from the NIA/NIH, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Flu Lab, and the Penn Center for Precision Medicine Accelerator Fund and in part by the AKO Foundation and by John Alexander, Marc J.

We therefore performed a genome-wide association study with a dimensional, PD/AG-related anxiety phenotype based on the Agoraphobia Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ) in a sample of 1370 healthy German volunteers of the CRC TRR58 MEGA study wave 1. A genome-wide significant association was found between ACQ and single non-coding nucleotide variants of the GLRB gene (rs78726293, P = 3.3 x 10(-8); rs191260602, P = 3.9 x 10(-8)). We followed up on this finding in a larger dimensional ACQ sample (N = 2547) and in independent samples with a dichotomous AG phenotype based on the Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90; N = 3845) and a case-control sample with the categorical phenotype PD/AG (N-combined = 1012) obtaining highly significant P-values also for GLRB single-nucleotide variants rs17035816 (P = 3.8 x 10(-4)) and rs7688285 (P = 7.6 x 10(-5)). GLRB gene expression was found to be modulated by rs7688285 in brain tissue, as well as cell culture. Analyses of intermediate PD/AG phenotypes demonstrated increased startle reflex and increased fear network, as well as general sensory activation by GLRB risk gene variants rs78726293, rs191260602, rs17035816 and rs7688285. Partial Glrb knockout mice demonstrated an agoraphobic phenotype. In conjunction with the clinical observation that rare coding GLRB gene mutations are associated with the neurological disorder hyperekplexia characterized by a generalized startle reaction and agoraphobic behavior, our data provide evidence that non-coding, although functional GLRB gene polymorphisms may predispose to PD by increasing startle response and agoraphobic cognitions.","[Deckert, J.; Weber, H.; Hommers, L.; Schartner, C.; Wolf, C.; Baumann, C.; Schiele, M.

International championships and their competitive athletes thrill millions of spectators who watch as eSports athletes and their teams try to improve and outperform each other. In order to achieve the necessary cognitive and physical top form and to counteract general health problems caused by several hours of training in front of the PC or console, eSports athletes need optimal cognitive, physical and mental training. However, a gap exists in eSports specific health management, including prevention of health issues and training of these functions. To contribute to this topic, we present in this mini review possible avenues for holistic training approaches for cognitively, physically and mentally fitter and more powerful eSports athletes based on interdisciplinary findings. We discuss exergames as a motivating and promising complementary training approach for eSports athletes, which simultaneously combines physical and cognitive stimulation and challenges in an attractive gaming environment. Furthermore, we propose exergames as innovative full-body eSports-tournament revolution. To conclude, exergames bring new approaches to (physical) eSports, which in turn raise new topics in the growing eSports research and development community.","[Martin-Niedecken, Anna Lisa] Zurich Univ Arts, Dept Design, Subject Area Game Design, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schattin, Alexandra] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Human Movement Sci & Sport, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Martin-Niedecken, AL (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Arts, Dept Design, Subject Area Game Design, Zurich, Switzerland.;Schättin, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Human Movement Sci & Sport, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",anna.martin@zhdk.ch; alexandra.schaettin@hest.ethz.ch,,"Schattin, Alexandra/0000-0002-0401-3285; Martin-Niedecken, Anna Lisa/0000-0001-8726-1120; Schattin, Alexandra/0000-0003-2831-3781",,,,,102,46,48,4,52,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, the precise adverse effects of these therapies on thyroid gland function have not been well described. Case Description: We report on 10 cases of painless thyroiditis syndrome (PTS) from a novel etiology, following immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) during treatment for metastatic malignancies. Six patients presented with transient thyrotoxicosis in which thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) were absent for all, whereas four patients had evidence of positive antithyroid antibodies. All thyrotoxic patients required temporary beta-blocker therapy and had spontaneous resolution of thyrotoxicosis with subsequent hypothyroidism. Four patients presented with hypothyroidism without a detected preceding thyrotoxic phase, occurring 6-8 weeks after initial drug exposure. All of these patients had positive antithyroid antibodies and required thyroid hormone replacement therapy for a minimum of 6 months. Conclusions: Patients receiving anti-PD-1 mAb therapy should be monitored for signs and symptoms of PTS which may require supportive treatment with beta-blockers or thyroid hormone replacement. The anti-PD-1 mAb is a novel exogenous cause of PTS and provides new insight into the possible perturbations of the immune network that may modulate the development of endogenous PTS, including cases of sporadic and postpartum thyroiditis.","[Orlov, Steven; Salari, Farnaz; Kashat, Lawrence; Walfish, Paul G.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Walfish, Paul G.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Div Endocrine, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Walfish, Paul G.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg Program, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; Univ Toronto, Sch Med, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada",University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; University of Toronto,"Walfish, PG (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Med Pediat Otolaryngol Pathol & Lab Med, 413-7,600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",pwalfish@mtsinai.on.ca,,,Abbott Laboratories Limited Canada; Da Vinci Gala Fundraiser; George Knudson Oakdale Pro-Am Charity Golf Tournament; Department of Medicine Research Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital; Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation of Toronto; Alex and Simona Shnaider Research Chair in Thyroid Oncology,Abbott Laboratories Limited Canada; Da Vinci Gala Fundraiser; George Knudson Oakdale Pro-Am Charity Golf Tournament; Department of Medicine Research Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital; Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation of Toronto; Alex and Simona Shnaider Research Chair in Thyroid Oncology,"This study was supported in part by unrestricted educational grants from Abbott Laboratories Limited Canada, the Da Vinci Gala Fundraiser, the George Knudson Oakdale Pro-Am Charity Golf Tournament, the Department of Medicine Research Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital, the Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation of Toronto, and the Alex and Simona Shnaider Research Chair in Thyroid Oncology.",,9,113,121,0,4,ENDOCRINE SOC,WASHINGTON,"2055 L ST NW, SUITE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-972X,1945-7197,,J CLIN ENDOCR METAB,J.

With a specific focus on the extra-time period, and using a within-match approach, we examined the influence of prolonged durations of professional soccer match-play on markers of technical (i.e., skilled) performance. In 18 matches involving professional European teams played between 2010 and 2014, this retrospective study quantified the technical actions observed during eight 15-minute epochs (E1: 00:00-14:59 min, E2: 15:00-29:59 min, E3: 30:00-44:59 min, E4: 45:00-59:59 min, E5: 60:00-74:59 min, E6: 75:00-89:59 min, E7: 90:00-104:59 min, E8: 105:00-119:59 min). Analysis of players who completed the demands of the full 120 min of match-play revealed that the cumulative number of successful passes observed during E8 (61 +/- 23) was lower than E1-4 (E1: 88 +/- 23, P = 0.001; E2: 77621, P = 0.005; E3: 79 +/- 18, P = 0.001; E4: 80 +/- 21, P = 0.001) and E7 (73 +/- 20, P = 0.002). Similarly, the total number of passes made in E8 (71 +/- 25) was reduced when compared to E1 (102 +/- 22, P = 0.001), E3 (91 +/- 19, P = 0.002), E4 (93 +/- 22, P <= 0.0005) and E7 (84 +/- 20, P = 0.001). The cumulative number of successful dribbles reduced in E8 (9 +/- 4) when compared to E1 (14 +/- 4, P = 0.001) and E3 (12 +/- 4, P <= 0.0005) and the total time the ball was in play was less in E8 (504 +/- 61 s) compared to E1 (598 +/- 70 s, P <= 0.0005). These results demonstrate that match-specific factors reduced particular indices of technical performance in the second half of extra-time. Interventions that seek to maintain skilled performance throughout extra-time warrant further investigation.","[Harper, Liam D.; West, Daniel J.; Stevenson, Emma; Russell, Mark] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Russell, M (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",mark.russell@northumbria.ac.uk,"West, Daniel/O-4127-2014; Harper, Liam/I-7866-2019; Russell, Mark/M-1652-2019","West, Daniel/0000-0003-2246-4925; Harper, Liam/0000-0002-2089-4799; Russell, Mark/0000-0002-7305-1090;",,,,,22,38,41,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,24-Oct,2014,9,10,,,,,,,e110995,10.1371/journal.pone.0110995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110995,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,AS0BL,25343724,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,7/25/25,WOS:000343943500073,View Full Record in Web of Science

DESIGN Retrospective observational study using the nationwide coronary care unit registry, SWEDEHEART. SETTING Sweden. PARTICIPANTS 283 014 cases of myocardial infarction reported to SWEDEHEART between 1998 and 2013. Symptom onset date was documented for all cases, and time to the nearest minute for 88%. INTERVENTIONS Myocardial infarctions with symptom onset on Christmas/New Year, Easter, and Midsummer holiday were identified. Similarly, myocardial infarctions that occurred during a FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, and winter and summer Olympic Games were identified. The two weeks before and after a holiday were set as a control period, and for sports events the control period was set to the same time one year before and after the tournament. Circadian and circaseptan analyses were performed with Sunday and 24:00 as the reference day and hour with which all other days and hours were compared. Incidence rate ratios were calculated using a count regression model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Daily count of myocardial infarction. RESULTS Christmas and Midsummer holidays were associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction (incidence rate ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.19, P<0.001, and 1.12, 1.07 to 1.18, P<0.001, respectively). The highest associated risk was observed for Christmas Eve (1.37, 1.29 to 1.46, P<0.001). No increased risk was observed during Easter holiday or sports events. A circaseptan and circadian variation in the risk of myocardial infarction was observed, with higher risk during early mornings and on Mondays. Results were more pronounced in patients aged over 75 and those with diabetes and a history of coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide real world study covering 16 years of hospital admissions for myocardial infarction with symptom onset documented to the nearest minute, Christmas, and Midsummer holidays were associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction, particularly in older and sicker patients, suggesting a role of external triggers in vulnerable individuals.","[Mohammad, Moman A.; Karlsson, Sofia; Haddad, Jonathan; Cederberg, Bjorn; Koul, Sasha; Erlinge, David] Lund Univ, Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Clin Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Jernberg, Tomas] Karolinska Inst, Danderyds Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindahl, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lindahl, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala Clin Res Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Frobert, Ole] Orebro Univ, Fac Hlth, Dept Cardiol, Orebro, Sweden",Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital; Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Orebro University,"Erlinge, D (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Clin Sci, Lund, Sweden.",david.erlinge@med.lu.se,"; Frobert, Ole/AFP-8888-2022","Mohammad, Moman Aladdin/0000-0003-4242-9801; ERLINGE, DAVID/0000-0003-3042-5766; Jernberg, Tomas/0000-0003-1695-379X; Frobert, Ole/0000-0002-5846-345X",Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation; Swedish Scientific Research Council; SSF (TOTAL-AMI); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Skane University Hospital fund; ALF fund,Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation(Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation); Swedish Scientific Research Council(Swedish Research Council); SSF (TOTAL-AMI); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Skane University Hospital fund; ALF fund,"This work was supported by The Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Swedish Scientific Research Council, SSF (TOTAL-AMI), Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and ALF and Skane University Hospital funds.

DMPA has been associated with increased risk of several viral infections including Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the current study, we used the mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) anogenital infection model to test two hypotheses: (1) contraceptives such as DMPA increase the susceptibility of the anogenital tract to viral infection and (2) long-term contraceptive administration induces more advanced disease at the anogenital tract. DMPA treatments of both athymic nude mice and heterozygous NU/J (Foxn1(nu/+)) but ovariectomized mice led to a significantly increased viral load at the anogenital tract, suggesting that endogenous sex hormones were involved in increased viral susceptibility by DMPA treatment. Consistent with previous reports, DMPA treatment suppressed host anti-viral activities at the lower genital tract. To test the impact of long-term contraceptive treatment on the MmuPV1-infected lower genital tract, we included two other treatments in addition to DMPA: 17 beta-estradiol and a non-hormone based contraceptive Cilostazol (CLZ, Pletal). Viral infections were monitored monthly up to nine months post infection by qPCR. The infected vaginal and anal tissues were harvested and further examined by histological, virological, and immunological analyses. Surprisingly, we did not detect a significantly higher grade of histology in animals in the long-term DMPA and 17 beta-estradiol treated groups when compared to the control groups in the athymic mice we tested. Therefore, although DMPA promotes initial papillomavirus infections in the lower genital tract, the chronic administration of DMPA does not promote cancer development in the infected tissues in our mouse model.","[Hu, Jiafen; Brendle, Sarah A.; Li, Jingwei J.; Cladel, Nancy M.; Shearer, Debra A.; Balogh, Karla K.; Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Hu, Jiafen; Brendle, Sarah A.; Li, Jingwei J.; Cladel, Nancy M.; Shearer, Debra A.; Balogh, Karla K.; Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Walter, Vonn] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Walter, Vonn] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Cooper, Timothy] NIAID, Integrated Res Facil Ft Detrick, NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Christensen, Neil D.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health,"Hu, JF (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.;Hu, JF (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",fjh4@psu.edu; sab40@psu.edu; jenny.jingwei.li@gmail.com; vwalter1@pennstatehealth.psu.edu; ncladel@gmail.com; timothy.cooper@nih.gov; dshearer@pennstatehealth.psu.edu; kkb4@psu.edu; ndc1@psu.edu,"; Walter, Vonn/AAI-3450-2021","Hu, Jiafen/0000-0001-8700-9937; Li, Jingwei (Jenny)/0009-0009-2140-231X; Walter, Vonn/0000-0001-6114-6714",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health [R21AI121822]; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health [1R21DE028650]; Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament,"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R21AI121822 (Christensen/HU), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number 1R21DE028650 (Hu), and the Jake Gittlen Memorial Golf Tournament.

During these periods of time, athletes need to prepare technically, tactically and physically for the next fixture and the short duration between fixtures means that, in some cases, physical preparation ceases, or training focus moves to recovery as opposed to progressing adaptations. Objective The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of training frequency on muscular strength to determine if a potential method to accommodate in-season resistance training, during busy training schedules, could be achieved by utilizing shorter more frequent training sessions across a training week. Methods A literature search was conducted using the SPORTDiscus, Ovid, PubMed and Scopus databases. 2134 studies were identified prior to application of the following inclusion criteria: (1) maximal strength was assessed, (2) a minimum of two different training frequency groups were included, (3) participants were well trained, and finally (4) compound exercises were included within the training programmes. A Cochrane risk of bias assessment was applied to studies that performed randomized controlled trials and consistency of studies was analysed using I-2 as a test of heterogeneity. Secondary analysis of studies included Hedges' g effect sizes (g) and between-study differences were estimated using a random-effects model. Results Inconsistency of effects between pre- and post-intervention was low within-group (I-2 = 0%), and moderate between-group (I-2 <= 73.95%). Risk of bias was also low based upon the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Significant increases were observed overall for both upper (p <= 0.022) and lower (p <= 0.008) body strength, pre- to post-intervention, when all frequencies were assessed. A small effect was observed between training frequencies for upper (g <= 0.58) and lower body (g <= 0.45). Conclusion Over a 6-12-week period, there are no clear differences in maximal strength development between training frequencies, in well-trained populations. Such observations may permit the potential for training to be manipulated around competition schedules and volume to be distributed across shorter, but more frequent training sessions within a micro-cycle rather than being condensed into 1-2 sessions per week, in effect, allowing for a micro-dosing of the strength stimuli.","[Cuthbert, Matthew; Haff, G.

A recent randomized community-based trial of an EBP for ADHD (Supporting Teens' Autonomy Daily; STAND) demonstrated suboptimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. In the present study, we conducted an Innovation Tournament (IT) with agency staff stakeholders (N = 26) to identify barriers to successful implementation of STAND and implementation strategies for a revised service delivery model. We conducted member-checking of agency staff-generated ideas with parents (N = 226) and subsequent querying of additional parent (N = 226) and youth-generated (N = 205) strategies to improve care. Go-Zone plots were utilized to identify strategies with the highest feasibility and importance. Practical barriers (i.e., transportation, scheduling difficulties) and parent/youth engagement were the most commonly cited obstacles to successful implementation of STAND in community contexts. Eighteen winning implementation strategies were identified that survived member checking. These were classified as train and educate stakeholders (n = 5; e.g., train agency supervisors to deliver supervision, digitize treatment materials and trainings), engage consumers (n = 9; e.g., begin treatment with rapport building sessions, increase psychoeducation), provide interactive assistance (n = 2; e.g., add group supervision, increase roleplay in supervision), and use of evaluative/iterative strategies (n = 2; e.g., perform fidelity checks, supervisor review of session recordings). Parents and youth desired longer duration of treatment and increased focus on maintenance. Strategies will be developed and tested as part of a pilot effectiveness trial designed to refine STAND's service delivery model.","[Sibley, Margaret H.; Zulauf-McCurdy, Courtney A.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sibley, Margaret H.; Ortiz, Mercedes] Seattle Childrens Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Rios-Davis, Alexandria; Graziano, Paulo A.; Bickman, Leonard] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Seattle Children's Hospital; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Sibley, MH (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Sibley, MH (corresponding author), Seattle Childrens Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",margaret.sibley@seattlechildrens.org,"Ortiz, Mercedes/P-5483-2016","Graziano, Paulo/0000-0003-2960-2331; Zulauf-McCurdy, Courtney/0000-0001-7236-4987",National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH106587],National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"This trial was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (Grant No. R01 MH106587).

Methods Twenty-one athletes (M-age = 18.5 +/- 0.6 years, M-height = 181.7 +/- 4.3 cm, M-weight = 81.4 +/- 7.1 kg), playing for national (n = 13) and international (n = 8) home clubs, answered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) before training camp (T1, day 1) and prior to tournament (T2, day 11). Results Overall, 9 players at T1 and 7 at T2 were identified as bad sleepers (PSQI > 5), while high sleepiness (ESS > 10) was found for 6 athletes at each measurement time. Group means and standard deviations reduced descriptively for PSQI (T1 = 5.38 +/- 2.31, T2 = 4.57 +/- 2.36) and ESS (T1 = 9.24 +/- 3.74, T2 = 8.48 +/- 3.28). Tendential differences were visible for PSQI in international-based players (Z = -1.7, p = 0.09) and ESS in first-national-league players (Z = -1.73, p = 0.08) over time. Higher PSQI values for international-based players (6.25 +/- 2.6) were found compared to first-national-league (5.83 +/- 1.60) and lower-league players (4.00 +/- 2.08), with large effect sizes for lower-league compared to international (d = 0.95) and national players (d = 0.98) at T1 and small effect sizes compared to first-league players (d = 0.24) at T2. Conclusion Findings emphasize great vulnerability and individuality and underline the importance of intraindividual sleep monitoring to meet the requirements needed to equally obtain health and enhance overall performance.","[Hof zum Berge, Annika; Loch, Fabian; Ferrauti, Alexander; Kellmann, Michael] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Sport Sci, Bochum, Germany; [Schwarzenbrunner, Karl] German Ice Hockey Federat, Munich, Germany; [Meyer, Tim] Saarland Univ, Inst Sports & Prevent Med, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Pfeiffer, Mark] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Sport Sci, Mainz, Germany; [Kellmann, Michael] Univ Queensland, Sch Human Movement & Nutr Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",Ruhr University Bochum; Saarland University; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Queensland,"zum Berge, AH (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Sport Sci, Bochum, Germany.",annika.hofzumberge@rub.de,"Ferrauti, Alexander/P-9577-2019; Hof zum Berge, Annika/ABC-5232-2020; Kellmann, Michael/J-3508-2014","Loch, Fabian/0000-0002-3530-5512; Kellmann, Michael/0000-0003-1699-9624; Alexander, Ferrauti/0000-0001-9807-2755; Meyer, Tim/0000-0003-3425-4546; Schwarzenbrunner, Karl/0000-0003-4084-5561; Pfeiffer, Mark/0000-0002-9287-5343; Hof zum Berge, Annika/0000-0002-7019-8652",German Federal Institute of Sport Science [IIA1-081901/12-20]; Projekt DEAL,German Federal Institute of Sport Science; Projekt DEAL,The study was initiated and funded by the German Federal Institute of Sport Science and realized within RegMan -Optimization of Training and Competition: Management of Regeneration in Elite Sports [grant number IIA1-081901/12-20].Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,51,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2509-3142,2509-3150,,GER J EXERC SPORT RE,Ger.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of overall, match and training IIRs in senior women's football, stratified by injury location, type and severity. Data sources MEDLINE via PubMed; EMBASE via Ovid; CINAHL via EBSCO and Web of Science were searched from earliest record to July 2021. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies (1) football players participating in a senior women's football league (amateur club or elite club) or a senior women's international football tournament; (2) the study had to report IIRs or provide sufficient data from which this outcome metric could be calculated through standardised equations; (3) a full-text article published in a peer-reviewed journal before July 2021; (4) a prospective injury surveillance study and (5) case reports on single teams were ineligible. Results 17 articles met the inclusion criteria; amateur club (n=2), elite club (n=10), international (n=5). Overall, match and training 'time-loss' IIRs are similar between senior women's elite club football and international football. 'Time-loss' training IIRs in senior women's elite club football and international football are approximately 6-7 times lower than their equivalent match IIRs. Overall 'time-loss' IIRs stratified by injury type in women's elite club football were 2.70/1000 hours (95% CI 1.12 to 6.50) for muscle and tendon, 2.62/1000 hours (95% CI 1.26 to 5.46) for joint and ligaments, and 0.76/1000 hours (95% CI 0.55 to 1.03) for contusions. Due to the differences in injury definitions, it was not possible to aggregate IIRs for amateur club football. Conclusion Lower limb injuries incurred during matches are a substantial problem in senior women's football. The prevention of lower limb joint, ligament, muscle and tendon injuries should be a central focus of injury prevention interventions in senior women's amateur club, elite club and international football.

Participants: All national team physicians and physiotherapists; Local Organising Committee (LOC) physicians working in the Medical Centres at the stadium and warm-up area. Main Outcome Measures: Frequency, characteristics, and incidence of injuries. Results: 192 injuries were reported, resulting in an incidence of 97 injuries per 1000 registered athletes. More than half of the injuries (56%) were expected to prevent the athlete from participating in competition or training. Eighty percent affected the lower extremity; the most common diagnosis was thigh strain (16%). In most cases, the injury was caused by overuse (44%). A quarter of the injuries were incurred during training and 137 (71%) in competition. On average, 72.4 injuries per 1000 competing athletes were incurred in competitions. The incidence of injury varied substantially among the disciplines. The risk of a time-loss injury was highest in heptathlon, women's 10,000 in, women's 3000 in steeplechase, decathlon, and men's marathon.

J,"Salisbury-Afshar, E",,,,"Salisbury-Afshar, Elizabeth",,,Financial Incentives for Improving the Quality of Primary Care,AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: The use of blended payment schemes in primary care, including the use of financial incentives to directly reward performance and quality, is increasing in a number of countries. There are many examples in the United States, and the Quality and Outcomes Framework for general practitioners in the United Kingdom is an example of a major system-wide reform. Despite the popularity of these schemes, there currently is little rigorous evidence of their success in improving the quality of primary health care, or of whether such an approach is cost-effective relative to other ways to improve the quality of care. Objectives: The aim of this review is to examine the effect of changes in the method and level of payment on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians, and to identify: (1) the different types of financial incentives that have improved quality; (2) the characteristics of patient populations for whom quality of care has been improved by financial incentives; and (3) the characteristics of primary care physicians who have responded to financial incentives. Search Strategy: The authors searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, HealthSTAR, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychLIT, and ECONLIT. Searches of Internet-based economics and health economics working paper collections were also conducted. Finally, studies were identified through the reference lists of retrieved articles, Web sites of key organizations, and from direct contact with key authors in the field. Articles were included if they were published from 2000 to August 2009. Selection Criteria: The authors selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series analyses evaluating the impact of different financial interventions on the quality of care delivered by primary care physicians. Quality of care was defined as patient-reported outcome measures, clinical behaviors, and intermediate clinical and physiologic measures.. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality, in consultation with two other review authors where there was disagreement. For each included study, the authors reported the estimated effect sizes and confidence intervals. Main Results: Seven studies were included in this review. Three of the studies evaluated single-threshold target payments; one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a specified outcome; one study evaluated payments based on the relative ranking of medical gfoups' performance (tournament-based pay); one study examined a mix of tournament-based pay and threshold payments; and one study evaluated changing from a blended-payments scheme to salaried payment. Three cluster RCTs examined smoking cessation; one controlled before-and-after study examined patients' assessment of the quality of care; one controlled before-and-after study examined cervical screening, mammography screening, and A1C level; one interrupted time series analysis focused on four outcomes in diabetes; and one controlled interrupted time series analysis (a difference-in-difference design) examined cervical screening, mammography screening, A1C level, childhood immunization, chlamydia screening, and appropriate asthma medication. Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on quality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. One study found no effect on quality of care. Poor study design led to substantial risk of bias in most studies. In particular, none of the studies addressed issues of selection bias as a result of the ability of primary care physicians to select into or out of the incentive scheme or health plan. Authors' Conclusions: The use of financial incentives to reward primary care physicians for improving the quality of primary health care services is growing. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of financial incentives to improve the quality of primary health care. Implementation should proceed with caution, and incentive schemes should be more carefully designed before implementation. In addition to basing incentive design more on theory, a large body of literature discussing experiences with these schemes can be used to draw out a number of lessons that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify the design of incentive schemes. More rigorous study designs need to be used to account for the selection of physicians into incentive schemes. The use of instrumental variable techniques should be considered to assist with the identification of treatment effects in the presence of selection bias and other sources of unobserved heterogeneity. In randomized trials, care must be taken in using the correct unit of analysis and more attention should be paid to blinding. Studies also should examine the potential unintended consequences of incentive schemes by having a stronger theoretical basis, including a broader range of outcomes, and conducting more extensive subgroup analysis. Studies should more consistently describe (1) the type of payment scheme at baseline or in the control group, (2) how payments to medical groups were used and distributed within the groups, and (3) the size of the new payments as a percentage of total revenue. Further research comparing the relative costs and effects of financial incentives with other behavior change interventions is also required.","Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Salisbury-Afshar, E (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA.",elizabeth.salisbury@gmail.com,"; Salisbury-Afshar, Elizabeth/AAK-4180-2020","Salisbury-Afshar, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4096-6822;",,,,,4,1,2,0,25,AMER ACAD FAMILY PHYSICIANS,KANSAS CITY,"8880 WARD PARKWAY, KANSAS CITY, MO 64114-2797 USA",0002-838X,1532-0650,,AM FAM PHYSICIAN,Am.

Given the vast numbers of athletes and those in the military who sustain rmTBI, the mounting evidence of the long-term and progressive sequelae of rmTBI, and the lack of targeted therapies to mitigate these sequelae, successful enrichment interventions in rmTBI could have large public health significance. Here, we evaluated enrichment strategies in an established pre-clinical rmTBI model. Seventy-one male C57BL/6 mice were randomized to two different housing conditions, environmental enrichment (EE) or normal condition (NC), then subjected to rmTBI injury (seven injuries in 9 days) or sham injury (anesthesia only). Functional outcomes in all four groups (NC-TBI, EE-TBI, NC-sham, and EE-sham) were assessed by motor, exploratory/anxiety, and mnemonic behavioral tests. At the synaptic level, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit expression of phosphorylated glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and calpain were evaluated by western blot. Compared to injured NC-TBI mice, EE-TBI mice had improved memory and decreased anxiety and exploratory activity post-injury. Treatment with enrichment also corresponded to normal NMDAR subunit expression, decreased GluR1 phosphorylation, decreased phosphorylated CaMKII, and normal calpain expression post-rmTBI. These data suggest that enrichment strategies may improve functional outcomes and mitigate synaptic changes post-rmTBI. Given that enrichment strategies are feasible in the clinical setting, particularly for athletes and soldiers for whom the risk of repetitive injury is greatest, these data suggest that clinical trials may be warranted.","[Liu, Xixia] Peoples Hosp Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jianhua; Alcon, Sasha; Hashim, Jumana; Meehan, William P., III; Mannix, Rebekah] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Emergency Med, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Qiu, Jianhua; Meehan, William P., III; Mannix, Rebekah] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Meehan, William P., III] Sports Concuss Clin, Div Sports Med, Boston, MA USA; [Meehan, William P., III] Micheli Ctr Sports Injury Prevent, Waltham, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Mannix, R (corresponding author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Emergency Med, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Rebekah.Mannix@childrens.harvard.edu,"; Mannix, Rebekah/AAD-8702-2020","Mannix, Rebekah/0000-0003-3608-2792; Hashim, Jumana/0000-0001-5663-2398",ABC-Clio publishing; Harvard Catalyst (the National Football League Players Association); National Hockey League Alumni Association through the Corey C.

In any elite sport, screening players using different scientific tools is an important injury prevention strategy. The Y-Balance test (YBT) was found to be a predictive tool for non-contact injury. However, the use of criteria from these tests to predict injuries has not been substantiated and should be further investigated. Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the predictors for injury among athletes using baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; the cutoff scores for predictors of injury, including baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; and the clinical prediction rules for predicting injury in this population. Methods A total of 39 young student football players were included in this study. The mean age was 20.28 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.83 kg/m(2). A baseline assessment of the participant's characteristics was taken and each participant performed the YBT once before starting the league. After the university league football players had finished their tournament, we asked them questions related to non-contact injuries. Results The results showed that the prevalence of injury was 17.95% among this population. An increase in the YBT score was significantly associated with a decrease in the odds of having an injury [odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 (0.88, 0.99), p = 0.047). In addition, the number of matches was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having an injury p = 0.012. However, the minutes of physical activity were not statistically significant p = 0.065. The highest Youden index was <= 97.89, with a sensitivity of 87.50% and specificity of 71.43%, for the posterior medial reach and <= 92.88, with a sensitivity of 90.62% and specificity of 57.14%, for the posterior lateral reach. The clinical prediction rule was an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. Conclusions The results of the study provide evidence for the potential utility of the YBT as a predictor tool for evaluating non-contact injuries in university league football players. By identifying players with lower YBT scores who were at higher risk for injury, targeted interventions could be implemented to address functional movement deficits and potentially reduce injury risk.","[Alkhathami, Khalid M.] Shaqra Univ, Hlth Rehabil, Shaqra, Saudi Arabia",Shaqra University,"Alkhathami, KM (corresponding author), Shaqra Univ, Hlth Rehabil, Shaqra, Saudi Arabia.",kalkhthami@su.edu.sa,"Alkhathami, Khalid/ABC-6655-2021","Alkhathami, Khalid/0000-0002-7630-5471",Deanship of Scientific Research at Shaqra University,Deanship of Scientific Research at Shaqra University,The author would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research at Shaqra University for supporting this work.,,33,2,2,1,6,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,21-May,2023,15,5,,,,,,,e39317,10.7759/cureus.39317,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.39317,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,L2LS9,37351231,"gold, Green Published",,,7/25/25,WOS:001021631400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that players in arenas with electric resurfacers would have normal, stable carboxyhemoglobin levels during games, whereas those in arenas with internal combustion engine (IC) resurfacers would have an increase in carboxyhemoglobin levels. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Enclosed ice arenas in the northeastern United States. Participants: Convenience sample of players aged 8 to 18 years old in 16 games at different arenas. Eight arenas (37 players) used an IC ice resurfacer and 8 arenas (36 players) an electric resurfacer. Interventions: Carboxyhemoglobin levels (SpCO) were measured using a pulse CO-oximeter before and after the game. Arena air was tested for carbon monoxide (CO) using a metered gas detector. Players completed symptom questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: The change in SpCO from pregame to postgame was compared between players at arenas with electric versus IC resurfacers. Results: Carbon monoxide was present at 6 of 8 arenas using IC resurfacers, levels ranged from 4 to 42 parts per million. Carbon monoxide was not found at arenas with electric resurfacers. Players at arenas with IC resurfacers had higher median pregame SpCO levels compared with those at electric arenas (4.3% vs 1%, P < 0.01). Players in the IC group also had a significant increase in their SpCO level during a hockey game compared with those in the electric group (2.8% vs 1%, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in symptom scores. Conclusions: Players at arenas operating IC resurfacers had significantly higher SpCO levels. Clinical Relevance: Youth hockey players in arenas with IC resurfacers have an increase in carboxyhemoglobin during games and have elevated baseline carboxyhemoglobin levels compared with players at arenas with electric resurfacers. Electric resurfacers decrease the risk of CO exposure.","[Macnow, Theodore] UMass Mem Childrens Med Ctr, Worcester, MA USA; [Macnow, Theodore] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Mannix, Rebekah; Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Emergency Med, Boston, MA USA; [Mannix, Rebekah; Meehan, William P., III] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Mannix, Rebekah; Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Brain Injury Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Meehan, William P., III] Micheli Ctr Sports Injury Prevent, Waltham, MA USA; [Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Sports Concuss Clin, Boston, MA USA; [Meehan, William P., III] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Sports Med, Boston, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; University Massachusetts Worcester Hospital; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital,"Macnow, T (corresponding author), UMass Mem Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, 55 Lake Ave North, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",Theodore.macnow@umassmemorial.org,"Macnow, Theodore/J-1046-2019; Mannix, Rebekah/AAD-8702-2020",", Theodore/0000-0003-1118-758X; Mannix, Rebekah/0000-0003-3608-2792;","Division of Sports Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA; National Football League Players Association; National Hockey League Alumni Association through Corey C.

We study three situations: in gain two players start with no prize and make sunk bids to win a prize; in loss both the players start with prizes and whoever loses the contest loses their prize; and in mixed only one player starts with a prize that stays with him if he wins, but is transferred to the rival otherwise. Since the differences among the treatments arise only from framing, the expected utility and the standard loss aversion models predict no difference in bids across treatments. We introduce a loss aversion model in which the property rights are made salient, and as a result the reference point varies across treatments. This model predicts average bids in descending order in the loss, the mixed, and the gain treatment; and higher bids by the player with property rights in the mixed treatment. The results from a laboratory experiment broadly support these predictions. There is no significant difference in bids in the loss (gain) treatment and bids by property rights holder (nonholder) in the mixed treatment. A model incorporating both loss aversion and social preferences explains this result.

A major focus for mental health services research is to develop effective and cost-effective strategies that increase the use of evidence-based assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches in community settings. Objective: The goal of this program of research is to apply insights from behavioral economics and participatory design to advance the science and practice of implementing evidence-based practice (EBP) for individuals with psychiatric disorders across the life span. Methods: Project 1 (Assisting Depressed Adults in Primary care Treatment [ADAPT]) is patient-focused and leverages decision-making heuristics to compare ways to incentivize adherence to antidepressant medications in the first 6 weeks of treatment among adults newly diagnosed with depression. Project 2 (App for Strengthening Services In Specialized Therapeutic Support [ASSISTS]) is provider-focused and utilizes normative pressure and social status to increase data collection among community mental health workers treating children with autism. Project 3 (Motivating Outpatient Therapists to Implement: Valuing a Team Effort [MOTIVATE]) explores how participatory design can be used to design organizational-level implementation strategies to increase clinician use of EBPs. The projects are supported by a Methods Core that provides expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, participatory design, measurement, and associated statistical approaches. Results: Enrollment for project ADAPT started in 2018; results are expected in 2020. Enrollment for project ASSISTS will begin in 2019; results are expected in 2021. Enrollment for project MOTIVATE started in 2018; results are expected in 2019. Data collection had begun for ADAPT and MOTIVATE when this protocol was submitted. Conclusions: This research will advance the science of implementation through efforts to improve implementation strategy design, measurement, and statistical methods. First, we will test and refine approaches to collaboratively design implementation strategies with stakeholders (eg, discrete choice experiments and innovation tournaments). Second, we will refine the measurement of mechanisms related to heuristics used in decision making. Third, we will develop new ways to test mechanisms in multilevel implementation trials. This trifecta, coupled with findings from our 3 exploratory projects, will lead to improvements in our knowledge of what causes successful implementation, what variables moderate and mediate the effects of those causal factors, and how best to leverage this knowledge to increase the quality of care for people with psychiatric disorders.","[Beidas, Rinad S.; Pellecchia, Melanie; Stewart, Rebecca E.; Becker-Haimes, Emily M.; Candon, Molly; Cidav, Zuleyha; Fishman, Jessica; Lieberman, Adina; Zentgraf, Kelly; Mandell, David] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 3535 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Beidas, Rinad S.; Volpp, Kevin G.; Buttenheim, Alison N.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Beidas, Rinad S.; Volpp, Kevin G.; Buttenheim, Alison N.; Stewart, Rebecca E.; Candon, Molly; Cidav, Zuleyha] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Volpp, Kevin G.; Buttenheim, Alison N.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Ctr Hlth Incent & Behav Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Volpp, Kevin G.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Volpp, Kevin G.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Hlth Care Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Volpp, Kevin G.] Univ Penn, Penn Med Ctr Hlth Care Innovat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Volpp, Kevin G.] Crescenz VA Med Ctr, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Buttenheim, Alison N.] Univ Penn, Sch Nursing, Dept Family & Community Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Marcus, Steven C.] Univ Penn, Sch Social Policy & Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Olfson, Mark] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, 722 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Williams, Nathaniel J.] Boise State Univ, Sch Social Work, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Fishman, Jessica] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Columbia University; Boise State University; University of Pennsylvania,"Beidas, RS (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 3535 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",rbeidas@upenn.edu,"; Beidas, Rinad/ABG-2094-2021; Cidav, Zuleyha/JIF-9731-2023; Olfson, Mark/AAA-8547-2021; Mandell, David/H-2730-2012","Beidas, Rinad/0000-0001-6056-6071; Marcus, Steven/0000-0001-7819-3824; Pellecchia, Melanie/0000-0003-1924-0269; Becker-Haimes, Emily/0000-0002-9922-8667; Olfson, Mark/0000-0002-3958-5662; Candon, Molly/0000-0001-8312-951X",National Institute of Mental Health [P50 MH113840],National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the input from their community partners including the DBHIDS, Community Behavioral Health, the School District of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Health System, and the organizations and clinicians that serve the needs of individuals with mental health difficulties in the city of Philadelphia.

We report an experiment where subjects perform a real-effort task repeatedly in a flat-wage environment which varies the quality of feedback across treatments. In the baseline treatment, subjects receive no feedback about their rank in their group. In the two main treatments, feedback quality varies in that subjects know (High-Quality Feedback) or do not know (Low-Quality Feedback) their exact rank in their group. We show that the quality of feedback is an important driver of productivity. Average performance is significantly higher for high-quality feedback than for low -quality or no feedback, where no significant overall performance differences are observed.

The primary aim was to examine changes in psychological resilience subdimensions and pressure pain threshold (PPT) values in the thoracolumbar region before and after a one-month RWL period leading up to competition. Hypotheses included expectations of significant reductions in PPT values due to biomechanical and physiological changes during RWL, along with improvements in psychological resilience subdimensions due to structured routines and social support. Methods: Thirty-seven elite male athletes (age: 22.94 +/- 1.98) participated in the study. Psychological resilience was assessed using the Psychological Resilience Scale for Adults, and mechanical pain sensitivity was evaluated through Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) measurements. Measurements were conducted before and after the RWL period, spanning one month prior to competition. Results: The results revealed significant PPT values across all thoracolumbar segments after RWL (p < 0.001). Cohen's d values indicated large effect sizes for these changes (d = 2.10-2.36). The L5 segment exhibited the largest PPT decrease (t = -10.45, d = 2.36), while the Th1 segment showed the smallest decrease (t = -8.23, d = 2.10). Measurements taken at 4 cm from the spine midline also demonstrated significant PPT reductions (p < 0.001), with the highest change recorded in the L5 segment (t = -9.78, d = 2.30). Psychological resilience subdimensions, including structured style, social competence, future orientation, and social resources, improved significantly after RWL (p < 0.05), while family cohesion and personal strength did not show significant changes. Athletes who previously ranked in tournaments exhibited higher psychological resilience, potentially due to enhanced self-confidence. Discussion: These findings align with literature suggesting that competitive success and optimism play crucial roles in resilience development. Personality traits and perceived social support further contributed to the observed resilience levels. This study highlights the multidimensional impact of RWL, emphasizing its detrimental effects on pain sensitivity and its mixed outcomes on psychological resilience. RWL-associated increases in mechanical hyperalgesia, especially in the lumbar region, were attributed to biomechanical and neurophysiological factors. Enhanced psychological resilience observed in certain subdimensions underscores the importance of structured and social support systems in mitigating RWL-induced stress. Future research should explore interventions to optimize resilience and manage pain during RWL periods, focusing on individualized support strategies for athletes. These findings contribute to understanding the interplay between psychological and physiological factors during RWL, practical insights for athletic training.","[Caglar, Esin cagla; Ceylan, Levent; Camici, Furkan; Cicek, Guner] Hitit Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Corum, Turkiye; [Ermis, Sermin Agrali; Sahin, Fatma Nese] Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Ankara, Turkiye; [Elioz, Murat; Uzun, Recep Nur; Kusan, Muhammet; Bayraktar, Mustafa Tolga; Kucuk, Hamza] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Yasar Dogu Fac Sport Sci, Samsun, Turkiye",Hitit University; Ankara University; Ondokuz Mayis University,"Sahin, FN (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Ankara, Turkiye.",nesesahin@anakara.edu.tr,"; Kusan, Muhammet/ADW-3784-2022; Ceylan, Levent/AAA-1704-2021; Bayraktar, Mustafa Tolga/MSZ-5066-2025; Kucuk, Hamza/H-7378-2014; ÇAMİÇİ, Furkan/AGF-2441-2022; Agrali Ermis, sermin/GMW-8246-2022; CICEK, Guner/ISS-7491-2023; sahin, fatma/JRX-1940-2023","SAHIN, FATMA NESE/0000-0002-8777-5807;",,,,,55,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Prior research shows detectable changes in speech in Alzheimer's dementia and its clinical precursors. The current study assesses whether a fully automated speech-based artificial intelligence system can detect cognitive impairment and amyloid beta positivity, which characterize early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Two hundred participants (age 54-85, mean 70.6; 114 female, 86 male) from sister studies in the UK (NCT04828122) and the USA (NCT04928976), completed the same assessments and were combined in the current analyses. Participants were recruited from prior clinical trials where amyloid beta status (97 amyloid positive, 103 amyloid. negative, as established via PET or CSF test) and clinical diagnostic status was known (94 cognitively unimpaired, 106 with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease). The automatic story recall task was administered during supervised in-person or relemedicine assessments, where participants were asked to recall stories immediately and after a brief delay. An artificial intelligence text-pair evaluation model produced vector-based outputs from the original story text and recorded and transcribed participant recalls, quantifying differences between them. Vector-based representations were fed into logistic regression models, trained with tournament leave-pair-out cross-validation analysis to predict amyloid beta status (primary endpoint), mild cognitive impairment and amyloid beta status in diagnostic subgroups (secondary endpoints). Predictions were assessed by the are-a under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the test result in comparison with reference standards (diagnostic and amyloid status). Simulation analysis evaluated two potential benefits of speech-based screening: (i) mild cognitive impairment screening in primary care compared with the Mini-Mental State Exam, and (ii) pre-screening prior to PET scanning when identifying an amyloid positive sample. Speech-based screening predicted amyloid beta positivity (area under the curve =0.77) and mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (area under the curve = 0.83) in the full sample, and predicted amyloid beta in subsamples (mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease: area under the curve = 0.82; cognitively unimpaired: area under the curve = 0.71). Simulation analyses indicated that in primary care, speech-based screening could modestly improve detection of mild cognitive impairment (+8.5%), while reducing false positives (-59.1%). Furthermore, speech-based amyloid pre-screening was estimated to reduce the number of PET scans required by 35.3% and 35.5% in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired individuals, respectively. Speech-based assessment offers accessible and scalable screening for mild cognitive impairment and amyloid beta positivity.","[Fristed, Emil; Skirrow, Caroline; Meszaros, Marton; Lenain, Raphael; Meepegama, Udeepa; Weston, Jack] Novoic Ltd, London N1 7EU, England; [Papp, Kathryn, V] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Alzheimer Res & Treatment, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Papp, Kathryn, V] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ropacki, Michael] Strateg Global Res & Dev, Temecula, CA 94019 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Skirrow, C (corresponding author), Wenlock Studios, Off G05,50-52 Wharf Rd, London, England.",caroline@novoic.com,,"Papp, Kate/0000-0003-1687-4370; Skirrow, Caroline/0000-0001-8692-7787",Novoic Ltd.,Novoic Ltd.,The study was funded by Novoic Ltd.,,55,8,8,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2632-1297,,BRAIN COMMUN,Brain Commun.,1-Sep,2022,4,5,,,,,,,,10.1093/braincomms/fcac231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac231,,,12,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,5J1RW,36381988,"gold, Green Published",,,7/25/25,WOS:000868824500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The combination of dasatinib and PDT with the silicone phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4 was assessed for increased killing of SCCVII mouse squamous cell carcinoma cells, a preclinical model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, using apoptotic markers and colony formation as experimental end-points. Because each of these treatments regulates the metabolism of the sphingolipid ceramide, their effects on mRNA levels of ceramide synthase, a ceramide-producing enzyme, and the sphingolipid profile were determined. PDT + dasatinib induced an additive loss of clonogenicity. Unlike PDT alone or PDT + dasatinib, dasatinib induced zVAD-fmk-dependent cell killing. PDT or dasatinib-induced caspase-3 activation was potentiated after the combination. PDT alone induced mitochondrial depolarization, and the effect was inhibited after the combination. Annexin V+ and propidium iodide+ cells remained at control levels after treatments. In contrast to PDT alone, dasatinib induced upregulation of ceramide synthase 1 mRNA, and the effect was enhanced after the combination. Dasatinib induced a modest increase in C20:1-and C22-ceramide but had no effect on total ceramide levels. PDT increased the levels of 12 individual ceramides and total ceramides, and the addition of dasatinib did not affect these increases. PDT alone decreased substantially sphingosine levels and inhibited the activity of acid ceramidase, an enzyme that converts ceramide to sphingosine. The data suggest that PDT-induced increases in ceramide levels do not correlate with ceramide synthase mRNA levels but rather with inhibition of ceramidase. Cell killing was zVAD-fmk-sensitive after dasatinib but not after either PDT or the combination and enhanced cell killing after the combination correlated with potentiated caspase-3 activation and upregulation of ceramide synthase 1 mRNA but not the production of ceramide. The data imply potential significance of the combination for cancer treatment.","[Separovic, Duska; Breen, Paul; Boppana, Nithin B.; Joseph, Nicholas] Wayne State Univ, Eugene Applebaum Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Separovic, Duska; Van Buren, Eric] Wayne State Univ, Karmanos Canc Inst, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Kraveka, Jacqueline M.; Rahmaniyan, Mehrdad; Li, Li] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Pediat, Div Hematol Oncol, Charles Darby Childrens Res Inst, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Kraveka, Jacqueline M.; Rahmaniyan, Mehrdad; Li, Li] Med Univ S Carolina, Hollings Canc Ctr, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Gudz, Tatyana I.] Med Univ S Carolina, Ralph H Johnson Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Gudz, Tatyana I.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Bielawska, Alicja; Bai, Aiping; Bielawski, Jacek; Pierce, Jason S.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Korbelik, Mladen] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada",Wayne State University; Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute; Wayne State University; Medical University of South Carolina; Medical University of South Carolina; Medical University of South Carolina; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Ralph H Johnson VA Medical Center; Medical University of South Carolina; Medical University of South Carolina; British Columbia Cancer Agency,"Separovic, D (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 259 Mack Ave, Detroit, MI 48201 USA.",dseparovic@wayne.edu,"Boppana, Nithin/I-8118-2019; Kraveka, Jacqueline/JDM-4359-2023","Van Buren, Eric/0000-0002-4446-5788;","U.S. Public Health Service from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 CA77475]; NIH [P20-RR17677]; Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research; Hyundai Hope on Wheels; Monica Kreber Golf Tournament; Chase after a Cure Foundation; Veterans Administration Merit Awards from RRD program; Veterans Administration Merit Awards from BLRD program; (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University), NCI [P30 CA22453]; (Medical University of South Carolina), NCI [IPO1CA097132, P30 CA 138313]; NIH/NCRR SC COBRE from the Extramural Research Facilities Program of the National Center for Research Resources [P20 RR017677, C06 RR018823]","U.S. Public Health Service from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research; Hyundai Hope on Wheels; Monica Kreber Golf Tournament; Chase after a Cure Foundation; Veterans Administration Merit Awards from RRD program; Veterans Administration Merit Awards from BLRD program; (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University), NCI; (Medical University of South Carolina), NCI; NIH/NCRR SC COBRE from the Extramural Research Facilities Program of the National Center for Research Resources","This study was supported by U.S. Public Health Service Grants: to D.

ED clinicians evaluating children with concussion should first ensure the absence of more serious injuries requiring immediate intervention, such as intracranial hemorrhage or cervical spine injury. In the ED setting, signs and symptoms of concussion are sometime subtle and often overlooked. A thorough physical exam is warranted but may be normal. Imaging and laboratory studies have no role in concussion diagnosis and should be reserved for cases where an injury requiring immediate intervention is suspected. Symptom management may include avoiding symptom-triggers (such as bright lights triggering headaches) and/or specific treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or antiemetics.

Our participants were asked to divide 1,000 units of currency between two assets - one risky and the other risk-free - in four different settings. We use different treatments to change the risk-free rate while keeping the risk premium constant. We find that risk-free rates affect risk allocation asymmetrically: subjects increase the risky portion in their portfolios in response to a decrease in rates. Still, they do not change their portfolios when rates rise. Furthermore, this asymmetric effect occurs only when interest rates remain constant over a relatively long duration; when they are volatile, their impact on risk allocation is reversed.

The main finding is that a better BE reduces the WFPG between management and regular employees. After a series of endogeneity treatments and robustness tests, this conclusion remains unchanged. The results of mechanism analysis suggest that intensifying market competition and the alleviating agency problems are two important channels for this effect. Heterogeneity tests indicate a stronger effect for non-state owned enterprises, firms with worse governance, and firms in noncompetitive industries. Additional analysis indicates that human resources, the innovation environment, and financial services are the main factors through which the BE affects the WFPG.

We previously demonstrated that fenretinide (4-HPR) inhibited DES activity in SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we investigated whether 4-HPR acted directly on the enzyme in vitro. N-C8:0-D-erythro-dihydroceramide (C-8-dhCer) was used as a substrate to study the conversion of dihydroceramide into ceramide in vitro using rat liver microsomes, and the formation of tritiated water after the addition of the tritiated substrate was detected and used to measure DES activity. NADH served as a cofactor. The apparent K-m for C-8-dhCer and NADH were 1.92 +/- 0.36 mu M and 43.4 +/- 6.47 mu M, respectively; and the V-max was 3.16 +/- 0.24 and 4.11 +/- 0.18 nmol/min/g protein. Next, the effects of 4-HPR and its metabolites on DES activity were investigated. 4-HPR was found to inhibit DES in a dose-dependent manner. At 20 min, the inhibition was competitive; however, longer incubation times demonstrated the inhibition to be irreversible. Among the major metabolites of 4-HPR, 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-oxo-4-HPR) showed the highest inhibitory effect with substrate concentration of 0.5 mu M, with an IC50 of 1.68 mu M as compared with an IC50 of 2.32 mu M for 4-HPR. N-(4-Methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-MPR) and 4-Oxo-N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-oxo-4-MPR) had minimal effects on DES activity. A known competitive inhibitor of DES, C-8-cyclopropenylceramide was used as a positive control. These studies define for the first time a direct in vitro target for 4-HPR and suggest that inhibitors of DES may be used as therapeutic interventions to regulate ceramide desaturation and consequent function.","[Rahmaniyan, Mehrdad; Kraveka, Jacqueline M.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Pediat, Div Hematol Oncol, Charleston, SC USA; [Curley, Robert W.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Med Chem & Pharmacognosy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Obeid, Lina M.; Hannun, Yusuf A.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Obeid, Lina M.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Med, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Obeid, Lina M.] Ralph H Johnson Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",Medical University of South Carolina; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Medical University of South Carolina; Medical University of South Carolina; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Ralph H Johnson VA Medical Center,"Kraveka, JM (corresponding author), Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol, 135 Rutledge Ave,MSC 558, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.",kravekjm@musc.edu,"Kraveka, Jacqueline/JDM-4359-2023","obeid, lina/0000-0002-0734-0847","National Institutes of Health [K01-CA100767, P01-CA97132, R01-AG016583, R01-CA49837, C06-RR018823]; Office of Research and Development; Department of Veterans Affairs; Ralph H.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Sports medicine clinic. Participants: Adolescent athletes clinically diagnosed with a sport-related concussion and those without concussion. Forty-nine patients with concussion (mean age = 14.9 +/- 1.9y; 51% female; tested 7.0 +/- 3.0d postinjury) and 65 control participants (mean age= -14.9 +/- 1.6y; 52% female) completed the study (N =114). Interventions: Athletes with concussion completed a single-task and dual-task standing and walking protocol within 14 days of injury and were compared to those without concussion. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included gait speed, quiet stance (root mean square [RMS] coronal/sagittal plane sway), and cognitive performance (accuracy). Dual-task costs were calculated as the percentage change between single-task and dual-task conditions. Participants with concussion were then stratified by those who did and did not report subjective balance problems at the time of testing and compared using objective balance and gait metrics. Results: The concussion group walked slower during dual-task gait than controls (0.83 +/- 0.17 m/s vs 0.92 +/- 0.15 m/s; Cohen's d=0.53). Dual-task quiet stance RMS sway values were similar for concussion and control groups in coronal (1.20 +/- 0.52 m/s(-2) vs 1.26 +/- 0.65 m/s(-2); d=0.09) and sagittal (0.56 +/- 0.24 m/s(-2) vs 0.73 +/- 0.44 m/s(-2); d = 0.20) movement planes. The concussion participants with subjectively-reported balance problems had significantly greater walking speed dual-task costs than concussion participants without self-reported balance problems (-25 +/- 10% vs -19 +/- 9%; P = .02). Conclusions: Following concussion, adolescents demonstrate slower gait speeds, but similar quiet stance values relative to those without concussion. The study results indicate that tasks requiring greater motor coordination may elicit greater alterations following a concussion.

To empirically examine how interpersonal comparisons affect productivity, this study utilizes a lab-in-the-field experiment that was conducted in Bolivia among 285 dairy farmers. The experiment consists of a baseline effort-elicitation and three treatments. The first treatment reveals to participants their baseline rankings; the second treatment allows participants to pay to destroy the output of others in their group; and the third treatment introduces inequity by placing a randomly-chosen group member into a more favorable production setting. This paper reports three main findings. First, in the absence of destructive actions, low-productivity participants increase their productivity whereas high-productivity participants decrease their productivity. Second, more than half of the participants are willing to give up their earnings to destroy the output of their peers. Finally, those who were placed into a more favorable production setting have a 29% higher probability of being destroyed by somebody in their group, showing evidence of destructive actions being motivated by a sense of fairness.","[Zeballos, Eliana] USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zeballos, E (corresponding author), USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",eliana.zeballos@gmail.com,"; Zeballos, Eliana/IAP-5174-2023","Zeballos, Eliana/0000-0002-5229-7948;","Hemispheric Institute of the Americas Field Research Grant; Henry A.

In coaching environments specifically, there can only be confidence in the data generated from computerised notational systems if the system provides reliable information and statistics. There are many systems on the market that are being utilised by amateur club rugby coaches and performance analysts; yet only a few have been tested for reliability. The aim of the study is to firstly, determine the inter- and intra-coder reliability of a South African developed computerised notational systems and secondly, to compare the coding proficiency of Western Province Rugby Union club coaches versus an experienced coder. Five club coaches with no prior experience of computerised notational systems or coding and one experienced coder participated in the study. The participants (n = 6) each coded five international rugby matches and re-coded two of these matches to determine the intra-coder reliability. The reliability between the different coding agreements was measured using Cohen's kappa statistic (K). The study revealed a good inter-coder agreement for all the performance indicators (K = 0.79) with the strongest agreement being for the set pieces (K = 0.93). Very good intra-coder reliability was also revealed for all the coders; there was a mean of K = 0.82. Comparing the club coach's coding to the experienced coder showed a good mean agreement of K = 0.77. The study concluded that the EncodeProRX is a reliable computerised notational systems that can be accurately and consistently used in club rugby set-up.","[Painczyk, Heinrich; Kraak, Wilbur] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Hendricks, Sharief] Univ Cape Town, Dept Human Biol, Div Exercise Sci & Sports Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Hendricks, Sharief] Leeds Beckett Univ, Phys Act & Hlth, Inst Sport, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town; Leeds Beckett University,"Kraak, W (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Sport Sci, ZA-7602 Cape Town, Matieland, South Africa.",kjw@sun.ac.za,"Kraak, Wilbur/IYJ-0601-2023; Kraak, Wilbur/O-7992-2014","Kraak, Wilbur/0000-0002-8233-2839",National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),"The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to thank the National Research Foundation (NRF) for the financial assistance towards the research.",,25,6,6,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1747-9541,2048-397X,,INT J SPORTS SCI COA,Int.

Comparing group incentive and individual-incentive treatments, we find that the observed dynamics of both individual errors and worst performances within firms, after a phase of learning, are largely indistinguishable. Importantly, and possibly explaining our finding, more than 80% of our laboratory firms, notwithstanding initially widespread inefficiency, were eventually able to achieve and sustain efficient coordination despite the presence of an unforgiving payoff structure. This result, which may be due to the reduced strategic uncertainty so characteristic of chosen-effort weak-link game experiments, stands in stark contrast to standard results in the coordination game literature and provides an interesting challenge to test beds currently used.

The authors carry out their analysis based on panel regression models.Findings The authors find that within-firm pay inequality increases as firms grow. Further, they identify that this trend is mainly driven by top-occupation workers receiving more significant wage increases compared to lower-level workers as firms expand. Once the authors address concerns about endogeneity, they find that pay inequality is negatively associated with firm performance.Practical implications Developing strategies and policies that prioritize fairness and transparency in compensation practices is crucial during the expansion process of firms. By actively discouraging rent-seeking behavior, firms can create a work environment that promotes productivity and sustainability, ultimately leading to improved firm performance. The research findings highlight the importance of implementing context-specific interventions, recognizing that different environments may require tailored approaches to address pay inequality effectively.Originality/value This study contributes to the study of within-firm pay inequality, firm size and performance in an emerging economy, an area that has been largely overlooked in previous empirical research. The contrasting findings show the importance of the structural and industrial characteristics of emerging markets that contribute to broader and deeper impact of pay inequality compared to developed economies.","[Yergabulova, Aigerim; Subramanian, Venkat] Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Business, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Alpysbayeva, Dinara] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway",Nazarbayev University; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Yergabulova, A (corresponding author), Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Business, Astana, Kazakhstan.",aigerim.yergabulova@nu.edu.kz; dinara.alpysbayeva@nmbu.no; subban.venkat@nu.edu.kz,"Alpysbayeva, Dinara/MGB-3316-2025","Alpysbayeva, Dinara/0000-0001-6248-1506",Nazarbayev University's Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants program [16133385 - GSB2020001],Nazarbayev University's Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants program,This research was funded by Nazarbayev University's Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants program (Funder Project Reference: 16133385 - GSB2020001).,,48,0,0,2,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-7720,1758-6577,,INT J MANPOWER,Int.

However, in such settings, overprovision of effort could arise if workers are uncertain whether their performance suf-fices to secure the output-based rewards. Performance feedback can reduce or eliminate such uncertainty. We demonstrate in a laboratory experiment that a precautionary effort motive can lead to overprovision of costly effort in work environments with working time autonomy in the absence of feedback. A key feature of our design is that it allows for a clean measurement of effort overprovision by keeping performance per unit of time fixed, which we achieve by calibrating subjects' productivity on a real effort t ask ex ante. This novel design can serve as a workhorse for various experiments as it allows for exogenous variation of performance certainty (i.e., by providing feedback), working time autonomy, productivity, effort cost s, and the general incentive structure. We find that subjects pro-vide significantly more costly effort beyond a level necessary to meet their performance targets in the presence of uncertainty, i.e., the absence of feedback, which suggests that feedback shields workers from overprovision of costly effort. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Sport is seen as gendered, exemplifying hegemonic masculinity and associated violence, with the link between sporting culture and violence against women well recognised. This paper reports on a systematic review of empirical research literature exploring the link between major sporting events and incidence of DV. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Proquest Central databases from inception to December 2020 for quantitative studies examining major sports events and reports of DV using a pre-post comparison design. Study quality was assessed using the Kmet quality assessment tool. The review identified 1445 records following duplicate removal. Once screened and assessed for eligibility, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Results are presented qualitatively due to the heterogeneity across studies. Most studies originated in North America and the United Kingdom, used police records as their data source for measuring incidences of DV and few looked beyond the day of the sports event for recorded incidences of DV. Studies reviewed suggested that there is an association between certain major sports events and increased reporting of DV. However, studies' findings conflicted with regards to whether increases were associated with contact sports, the rivalry between competing teams, whether the events were emotionally salient and whether alcohol was a contributing factor. In conclusion, there is limited research globally. Heterogeneity and conflicting findings mean that more research is needed to understand the associations and inform community prevention/interventions to address DV.","[Forsdike, Kirsty; O'Sullivan, Grant] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Ctr Sport & Social Impact, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hooker, Leesa] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Rural Hlth Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hooker, Leesa] La Trobe Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Judith Lumley Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University; La Trobe University; La Trobe University,"Forsdike, K (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",k.forsdike@latrobe.edu.au,"; Forsdike, Kirsty/ITT-2569-2023","Hooker, Leesa/0000-0002-4499-1139; Forsdike, Kirsty/0000-0001-7725-0831",,,,,56,13,13,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0966-0410,1365-2524,,HEALTH SOC CARE COMM,Health Soc.

To attain the aim of this study, literature search was performed under following inclusion criteria: (1) included participants with Down syndrome, (2) implemented a neuromuscular training intervention and measured outcome variables of general strength, maximal strength, and functional mobility tasks, (3) had a group of participants whose mean ages were under 30 years old, (4) employed a prospective controlled design, and (5) used mean and standard deviations to express the outcome variables. Effect size was calculated from each study based on pre- and post-testing value differences in general strength, maximal strength, and functional mobility tasks between control and intervention groups. The effect size was further classified in to one of the following categories: small, moderate, and large effects. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Analysis indicated large to moderate effects on general strength, moderate to small effects on maximal strength, and small effect on functional mobility tasks by neuromuscular training. Conclusions: Although there were limited studies, the results showed that neuromuscular training could be used as an effective intervention in children and young adults with Down syndrome. What this paper adds: Synthesis of seven reviewed studies indicated that neuromuscular training could be beneficial to optimize general and maximal muscular strength development in children and young adults with Down syndrome.

In the US Midsouth, rice plants get exposed to variable temperatures depending on the planting date. We hypothesize that rice cultivars vary in their response to temperature, and developing a method for low- and high-temperature tolerance screening will help producers and breeders to select cultivars for management and breeding, respectively. Four rice cultivars, CL152, Bowman, Antonio, and Mermentau along with two hybrids XL 753 and CLXL 745 that were the most commonly grown in the US Midsouth were evaluated in this study for temperature tolerance. Five day/night temperature treatments, 20/12 (very low), 25/17 (low), 30/22 (optimum), 35/27 (high), and 40/32 degrees C (very high) were imposed after the seedling establishment, ten days after planting (DAP). Growth and developmental parameters including root and physiological parameters were recorded from plants harvested at 39 DAP. Rice cultivars and hybrids exhibited significant variability in their response to low and high temperatures. Based on total low- and high-temperature response indices, relative temperature response scores were derived. Total low-temperature response index values ranged from 18.48 to 23.15 whereas total high-temperature responses index values ranged from 42.01 to 48.82. Antonio, CLXL 745, and Mermentau were identified as sensitive to cold and heat, Bowman as sensitive to cold and moderately sensitive to heat, CL152 was moderately sensitive to cold and heat, and XL 753 was highly cold and heat tolerant cultivars/hybrids tested. These results may be useful for breeders to develop new rice cultivars which could withstand low-and high-temperature conditions during seedling stages. Further large-scale studies are needed to evaluate more cultivars or lines both in the controlled environments and field settings to come up with practical recommendations.","[Jumaa, S. H.; Reddy, K.

Under such conditions of physical stress, significant damage to muscle cells occurs, greater than in typically aerobic efforts. Among the strongest stimuli causing these changes are the mechanical and metabolic stresses associated with the physiological cost of exercise, which can be exacerbated when working at elevated ambient temperatures. The aim of our research was to obtain knowledge about the relationship between the effect of a special fitness test conducted at two different ambient temperatures and the level of heat stress in judokas.Material & Methods: The study was carried out among a group of 15 professional judo athletes aged 20.65 +/- 2.03 years with an average aerobic capacity level. The research protocol consisted of two main parts with separate tasks. Part one was the preliminary study (stage I, II and III), and part two was the main study (stage IV and V). The performance tests were conducted during the starting period and took place in a thermoclimatic chamber and an air-conditioned labora- tory. In Stage I, selected anthropometric and circulatory indicators were measured. Stage II involved the male sub- jects performing an exercise test assessing anaerobic and aerobic capacity with the lower limbs (LL) and after sev- en days with the upper extremities (AA) (stage III). The Wingate test for lower limbs (LL) and upper limbs (AA) was used to assess anaerobic capacity indices. After a minimum of 2h after completing the Wingate Test, the subjects took a test to assess aerobic capacity. To assess aerobic capacity, a direct method was used - a test with gradually increasing load performed on a cycloergometer to refusal to continue due to extreme fatigue. The test determined physiological indicators at the level of the second ventilation threshold (VT2) and at the maximum level (VO2max). In the main study (stage IV and V), half of the male subjects performed 5 restrictive pulse exercise sequences on a foot cycloergometer and hand cycloergometer in a thermoclimatic chamber at 21 +/- 0.5(degrees)C (stage IV) and the oth- V. This time, the first group of subjects performed the exercise at 31 +/- 0.5(degrees)C and the second half at 21 +/- 0.5(degrees)C. The interval effort was characterized by pulsatile, alternating, time-varying loading of the upper and lower extremities during anaerobic exercise series punctuated by 15-minute rest intervals.Results: In the Wingate test with the lower extremities, the maximum anaerobic power (RPP) was 12.12 +/- 0.87 W center dot kg(-1), and with the upper extremities it was 7.00 +/- 0.56 W center dot kg(-1). Total work (TW) in the test with the lower extremi- ties was 21.85 +/- 4.26 kJ and with the upper extremities 13.36 +/- 2.50 kJ. The result of VO2max measurement for the lower limbs averaged 43.23 +/- 7.79 ml.kg(-1) center dot min(-1), and for the upper limbs 37.19 +/- 5.26 ml.kg(-1) center dot min(-1). HRmax recorded in the graded test for the lower limbs averaged 185 +/- 8.19 bpm and for the test for the lower limbs: 183 +/- 8.43 bpm. The time to reach VT2 averaged 11.50 +/- 3.09 min for the lower extremities and 8.32 +/- 2.99 min for the upper extremities. At the second ventilation threshold, the heart rate of contraction (HRVT2) was 168 +/- 8.42 bpm (LL) and 162 +/- 8.75 bpm (AA). The percentage of oxygen uptake at the second ventilation threshold (%VO(2)max) was 77.68 +/- 9.61% (LL) and 71.88 +/- 11.65% (AA), respectively. As a result of exercise dehydration at 21(degrees)C and 31(degrees)C, there was a statistically significant reduction in body weight (p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the BM values recorded after a series of exercise at 21(degrees)C and 31(degrees)C. PSI and CHSI values were statistically significantly higher for exercise performed at 31(degrees)C. Conclusions: Different ambient thermal conditions do not affect the volume of work performed in pulsatile anaerobic exercise, which does not support the view represented by some researchers about the effect of ambient tempeature on anaerobic capacity. The tested athletes tolerated the thermal load well and their subjective assessment of the strenuousness of the work, did not differ in the ambient temperatures used. The greater weight loss, and thus dehydration, observed in athletes after exercise at elevated ambient temperatures may be related to a widening of their capillary network in both muscle and skin, influenced by years of training, which also increases the body's water percentage which promotes sweat transpiration. In order to increase the body's tolerance to heat and exercise stress, it is reasonable in professional judokas to conduct training under varous ambient thermal conditions.","[Palka, Tomasz; Tota, Lukasz] Univ Phys Educ Krakow, Fac Phys Educ & Sport, Dept Physiol & Biochem, Krakow, Poland; [Rydzik, Lukasz; Lech, Grzegorz; Ambrozy, Tadeusz; Wasacz, Wojciech] Univ Phys Educ Krakow, Inst Sports Sci, Fac Phys Educ & Sport, Krakow, Poland; [Witkowski, Kazimierz; Kubacki, Rafal] Wroclaw Univ Hlth & Sport Sci, Fac Phys Educ & Sports, Wroclaw, Poland; [Leiva-Arcas, Alejandro] Univ Catolica San Antonio Murcia, Fac Sport, Murcia, Spain; [Piotrowska, Anna] Univ Phys Educ Krakow, Fac Physiotherapy, Dept Chem & Biochem, Krakow, Poland; [Czarny, Wojciech] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Phys Culture Studies, Coll Med Sci, Rzeszow, Poland; [Czarny, Wojciech] Univ Presov, Dept ports Kinanthropol, Presov, Slovakia; [Rydzik, Lukasz] Univ Phys Educ, Al Jana Pawl 278, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland",Universidad Catolica de Murcia; University of Rzeszow; University of Presov,"Rydzik, L (corresponding author), Univ Phys Educ, Al Jana Pawl 278, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland.",lukasz.rydzik@awf.krakow.pl,"Czarny, Wojciech/AAA-5561-2020; Rydzik, Łukasz/AAZ-6020-2020; Pałka, Tomasz/HKH-0420-2023; Ambroży, Tadeusz/AAZ-4796-2021; Piotrowska, Anna/R-6088-2018","Wasacz, Wojciech/0000-0002-7392-5229; Leiva Arcas, Alejandro/0000-0002-2096-0274;",Departmental sources,Departmental sources,Departmental sources,,78,7,7,2,11,"INT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, INC",MELVILLE,"150 BROADHOLLOW RD, STE 114, MELVILLE, NY 11747 USA",1643-8698,,,ARCH BUDO,Arch.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in using electricity to sedate fish; two methods include (1) lower-voltage, non-pulsed-DC fish handling gloves (FHGs) that tend to only sedate fish while the gloves are touching the animal; and (2) a comparatively high-voltage, pulsed-DC Portable Electrosedation System (PES) that leads to galvanonarcosis. This study compared the physiological consequences of exposure to FHGs and PES in teleost fish. Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides were exposed to FHGs, PES, or a handling control for a 3-min simulated surgery. Blood was then sampled at 0.5 and 4.5h postexposure and was analyzed for blood glucose, blood lactate, and plasma cortisol concentrations. Opercular rates were monitored during surgery, at 2min postsurgery, and 0.5h postsurgery. At 24h postsurgery, time to exhaustion (via a standardized swimming chase protocol) was assessed. Fish exposed to FHGs tended to exhibit lower opercular rates than fish that were sedated with the PES during simulated surgery. Cortisol levels of Largemouth Bass treated with FHGs were higher than those of fish sedated with the PES. Glucose levels recorded for Bluegills at 4.5h postsurgery were higher with FHGs than with the PES. In both species, lactate was lower for fish treated with FHGs than for those treated with the PES. At 24h posttreatment, Bluegills sedated with FHGs exhibited a longer time to exhaustion than those subjected to the PES, whereas Largemouth Bass sedated with the PES exhibited a longer time to exhaustion than those sedated with FHGs. Physiological responses to treatments were inconsistent between species. Further investigation to determine the optimal electrosedation method is required.","[Abrams, Alice E.

A single judge may write a judicial opinion, but only after an (often large) group of lawyers chooses litigation strategies, crafts arguments, and presents their positions. Despite their important role in the legal process, these networks of lawyers are almost uniformly overlooked in legal scholarship-a black box in a discipline otherwise obsessed with institutional detail.This Article focuses on a particularly crucial way that the structure of professional networks may shape the path of the law. Prior qualitative research suggests that networks are an important source of information, mentoring, and opportunity, and that those social resources are often withheld from lawyers who do not mirror the characteristics of the typically male, wealthy, straight, and white incumbents in the field. We have a common nickname for the networks that result, which are ostensibly open but often closed in practice: old boys' networks.For the first time in legal scholarship, this Article quantitatively analyzes gender representation within a comprehensive network of judges and litigators over a significant period of time. The network studied is derived from cases before the Delaware Court of Chancery, a systemically important trial court that adjudicates the most-and the most important-corporate law disputes in the United States. Seventeen years of docket entries across more than fifteen thousand matters and two thousand seven hundred attorneys were collected as the basis for a massive network. Analyzing the Chancery Litigation Network produces a number of important findings. First, we find a dramatic and persistent gender gap in the network. Women are not only outnumbered in the network but also more peripheral within it compared to men. Second, we find that law firm membership and geographical location interact with gender-women's positions within the network differ by membership in certain firms or residence in particular geographies. Finally, as we drill down into the personal networks of individual women, we find arresting evidence of the social barriers female Chancery litigators regularly confront: from working overwhelmingly-sometimes exclusively-with men in the early years of their careers to still being shut out of male-dominated cliques as their careers mature.The Article's findings set the stage for subsequent research to test the connection between gender representation in litigation networks and discrete outcomes, such as the incidence of bias in judicial opinions. It also demonstrates how subsequent research can incorporate network structure into quantitative and qualitative studies of not only gender bias but also other forms of inequality in law. With respect to policy, it provides the necessary first step to crafting normative interventions that improve equitable access to social resources by making networks more empirically concrete. With that added clarity, the network approach then allows us to calibrate remedial options available to bar associations, law firms, and individual attorneys, leaving no level of the institutional setting untouched.",,,,,,,,,,,201,1,1,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO LAW SCH,CHICAGO,"1111 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0041-9494,,,U CHICAGO LAW REV,Univ.

We argue that feedback affects beliefs in different dimensions - namely beliefs about the level of human capital and beliefs about the ability to learn and this may explain some of the ambiguous effects. We experimentally study the causal effects of an exogenously administered change in beliefs in both of these dimensions on the motivation to learn. We find that confidence in the ability to learn raises incentives, while confidence in the level of human capital lowers incentives for individuals with high levels of human capital.

However, this prior empirical work may be biased by preferential admission of obese patients to ICUs, and little is known about other patient-centered outcomes following critical illness. We sought to determine whether 1-year mortality, healthcare utilization, and functional outcomes following a severe sepsis hospitalization differ by body mass index. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: U.S. hospitals. Patients: We analyzed 1,404 severe sepsis hospitalizations (1999-2005) among Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study, of which 597 (42.5%) were normal weight, 473 (33.7%) were overweight, and 334 (23.8%) were obese or severely obese, as assessed at their survey prior to acute illness. Underweight patients were excluded a priori. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Using Medicare claims, we identified severe sepsis hospitalizations and measured inpatient healthcare facility use and calculated total and itemized Medicare spending in the year following hospital discharge. Using the National Death Index, we determined mortality. We ascertained pre- and postmorbid functional status from survey data. Patients with greater body mass indexes experienced lower 1-year mortality compared with nonobese patients, and there was a -dose-response relationship such that obese (odds ratio = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.88) and severely obese patients (odds ratio = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.80) had the lowest mortality. Total days in a healthcare facility and Medicare expenditures were greater for obese patients (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), but average daily utilization (p = 0.44) and Medicare spending were similar (p = 0.65) among normal, overweight, and obese survivors. Total function limitations following severe sepsis did not differ by body mass index category (p = 0.64). Conclusions: Obesity is associated with improved mortality among severe sepsis patients. Due to longer survival, obese sepsis survivors use more healthcare and result in higher Medicare spending in the year following hospitalization. Median daily healthcare utilization was similar across body mass index categories.","[Prescott, Hallie C.; Langa, Kenneth M.; Iwashyna, Theodore J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chang, Virginia W.] NYU, Steindhart Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY USA; [O'Brien, James M., Jr.] Riverside Methodist Hosp, Columbus, OH 43214 USA; [Langa, Kenneth M.; Iwashyna, Theodore J.] VA Ctr Clin Management Res, HSR&D Ctr Excellence, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Langa, Kenneth M.; Iwashyna, Theodore J.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; New York University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Prescott, HC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hprescot@med.umich.edu,"; Langa, Kenneth/HGE-4815-2022","Langa, Kenneth/0000-0002-2798-1836; Prescott, Hallie/0000-0002-8442-6724; Iwashyna, Theodore/0000-0002-4226-9310","National Institutes of Health [NIH] [K08 HL091249, R01 AG030155, U01 AG09740]; Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Service [IIR 11-109]; American Diabetes Association; NIH; VA; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [T32HL007749] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [P30DK092926] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute on Aging [U01AG009740] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institutes of Health [NIH](United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Service(US Department of Veterans Affairs); American Diabetes Association(American Diabetes Association); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); VA(US Department of Veterans Affairs); National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"Dr. Prescott's institution received grant support (this work was supported by grants K08 HL091249, R01 AG030155, and U01 AG09740 from the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and IIR 11-109 from the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Service).

Overall, 339 athletes from 21 handball teams who participated in the two main Brazilian championships were followed up during a season. In total, 312 injuries were reported by 201 athletes. The injury incidence rate during training was 3.7/1000 h, and during matches was 20.3/1000 matches. Ankle (19.4%, n = 46) and knee (13.5%, n = 32) were the body regions most affected by traumatic injuries. Shoulders (44.0%, n = 33) and knee (26.7%, n = 20) were the body regions most affected by overuse injuries. Muscle injuries (27.1%, n = 68) was the traumatic injury type most reported. Tendinopathy (91.8%, n = 56) was the overuse injury type most observed. Previous injury (OR: 2.42, CI 95%: 1.51-3.89) and an additional match per week (OR: 1.31, CI 95%: 1.05-1.62) were associated with a higher risk of overuse injury. Female athletes (OR: 1.56, CI 95%: 1.08-2.25) and an additional hour of training per week (OR: 1.09, CI 95%: 1.02-1.15) were associated with a higher risk of traumatic injury. This study showed that athletes with previous injury have shown a high risk of developing an overuse injury.","[Giroto, N.; Hespanhol Junior, L. C.; Gomes, M. R. C.; Lopes, A.

In an effort to investigate DNMT genotype-specific effects on dimensional anxiety traits in addition to the categorical phenotype of panic disorder, 506 panic disorder patients and 3112 healthy participants were assessed for anxiety related cognition [Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ)], anxiety sensitivity [Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)] as well as pathological worry [Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)] and genotyped for five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in theDNMT3A(rs11683424, rs1465764, rs1465825) andDNMT3B(rs2424932, rs4911259) genes, which have previously been found associated with clinical and trait-related phenotypes. There was no association with the categorical phenotype panic disorder. However, a significant association was discerned betweenDNMT3Ars1465764 and PSWQ scores in healthy participants, with the minor allele conveying a protective effect. In addition, a marginally significant association between questionnaire scores (PSWQ, ASI) in healthy participants andDNMT3Brs2424932 was detected, again with the minor allele conveying a protective effect. The present results suggest a possible minor role ofDNMT3AandDNMT3Bgene variation in conveying resilience towards anxiety disorders. As the observed associations indicated a protective effect of two SNPs particularly with pathological worry, future studies are proposed to explore these variants in generalized anxiety disorder rather than panic disorder.","[Berking, Ann-Cathrine;

MicroRNAs regulate dynamic gene expression during synaptic plasticity and genetic variation of microRNAs modulating noradrenaline transporter gene (SLC6A2) expression may thus lead to altered central and peripheral processing of fear and anxiety. In silico prediction of microRNA regulation of SLC6A2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and identified hsa-miR-579-3p as a regulating microRNA. The minor (T)-allele of rs2910931 (MAF(cases) = 0.431, MAF(controls) = 0.368) upstream of MIR579 was associated with panic disorder in patients (p(allelic) = 0.004, n(cases) = 506, n(controls) = 506) and with higher trait anxiety in healthy individuals (p(ASI) = 0.029, p(ACQ) = 0.047, n = 3112). Compared to the major (A)allele, increased promoter activity was observed in luciferase reporter assays in vitro suggesting more effective MIR579 expression and SLC6A2 repression in vivo (p = 0.041). Healthy individuals carrying at least one (T)-allele showed a brain activation pattern suggesting increased defensive responding and sympathetic noradrenergic activation in midbrain and limbic areas during the extinction of conditioned fear. Panic disorder patients carrying two (T)-alleles showed elevated heart rates in an anxiety-provoking behavioral avoidance test (F(2, 270) = 5.47, p = 0.005). Fine-tuning of noradrenaline homeostasis by a MIR579 genetic variation modulated central and peripheral sympathetic noradrenergic activation during fear processing and anxiety. This study opens new perspectives on the role of microRNAs in the etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders, particularly their cardiovascular symptoms and comorbidities.","[Hommers, L.
