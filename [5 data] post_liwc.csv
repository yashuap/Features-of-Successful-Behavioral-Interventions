Binding Moral Foundations,"Protecting the Purity of Our Land
America is a land of pure beauty and pristine nature. Millions of domestic and international tourists visit our nation each year to experience our sacred wonders for themselves. From the mighty trees of Sequoia National Park to the untouched natural sculptures of Arches National Park to the pristine waterfalls and mountains of Yosemite, God has certainly blessed our land. We are the envy of the natural world.
What do you think? How much do you believe America‚Äôs treasures, should be kept pure, pristine, and sacred?
Please answer the prompt in at least 2 sentences using the text box below.

Unfortunately, we‚Äôre now at risk of losing it all. Our pristine nature and national parks ‚ÄìGod‚Äôs gift to us ‚Äì are descending into a shell of what they once were.
Click forward to see some examples.

Look at the Great Smoky Mountains in the picture below. On the left is what visitors used to see ‚Äì a spectacular view. But, on the right is what visitors see now because of the polluted air. It‚Äôs disgusting how much this natural wonder has been desecrated.
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, rated the worst among National Parks for air quality, seen here on a clear day and a polluted one. 
Do you agree?
How impure do you think the Great Smoky Mountains look to you in the picture on the right above?
How disgusting do you find this picture on the right of the Great Smoky Mountains to be?

Or look at Old Faithful. The geyser that has come to symbolize natural purity here on God‚Äôs green earth. As the climate warms in Yellowstone, Old Faithful has become less reliable and it is now feared that it may dry up forever. The desecration of this great symbol of America‚Äôs exceptional natural wonders is sacrilegious.
Do you agree?
How impure do you think it would be for Old Faithful to dry up forever due to pollution and a warming climate?
How disgusted would you feel if Old Faithful dried up entirely?

Or look at what is happening at Sequoia National Park ‚Äì the home of the worlds largest and most majestic trees. Only America has been blessed with these symbols of God‚Äôs greatness. Yet, rising temperatures and increased draught due to a warming climate has resulted in 85% of these giants being burned. They had lived on God‚Äôs green earth for thousands of years. It‚Äôs a sin to let this happen.
What do you think?
How sinful do you think it would be to let the Sequoia trees die off?
How disgusted would you feel if all of our precious Sequoia trees burned down?

In all, how much do you feel like we, as Americans, are failing to keep our American treasures, like the Smoky Mountains, Old Faithful, and the Sequoia Trees pure, pristine, and sacred?
Please answer the prompt in at least 2 sentences using the text box below.

There‚Äôs much to be done. America‚Äôs pristine nature, our sacred natural monuments and symbols must be preserved. We must fight against what is tainting our lands before it is too late. We must stop polluting the air. We must stop emitting unsustainable amounts of carbon into the air. We are causing the earth to warm and the warming is spoiling the purity of our national parks. If we don‚Äôt fight climate change‚Äôs effects on our nation‚Äôs greatest wonders, it will be a blemish on our history.",https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5dTAm4yD0gpZBUG,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,Image,8.0,7.0,1.0,1.6666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,18.6046511627907,9.615384615384617,8.695652173913043,7.142857142857142,Goldwert et al_.xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,592,80.46,91.16,22.85,31.89,14.1,21.45,78.89,67.4,50.68,10.3,6.25,0,3.55,2.2,0,0.51,4.05,13.68,7.43,1.18,14.19,8.78,3.72,4.05,0,15.2,10.47,3.89,4.39,3.55,0.51,0.34,18.24,0.84,9.46,4.39,2.87,1.86,1.86,0.68,1.35,0,5.24,3.04,2.2,0.68,0,0.68,0.17,0.17,0,0,9.97,3.72,0.51,0.34,0.34,1.18,0.68,6.25,0,0,0,0,0.51,0.34,0.17,0,3.38,0,0.17,0,0.34,2.87,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.51,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.34,0.51,0.68,6.93,10.14,0.68,0.51,5.74,2.36,0,1.69,3.89,2.03,4.73,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,10.64,5.07,3.38,2.03,0,0,0.17,0
Bipartisan Elite Cues,"With support from both Democratic and Republican legislators, as well as non-partisan scientists and policy analysts, the United States recently passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The law includes several aspects specifically aimed at addressing climate change. This includes funding for clean energy projects, such as solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources, to both reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and guarantee energy security for the country. Additionally, the law seeks to enhance public transportation through the investment in zero-emission and more modern transit buses and ferries, while also establishing a comprehensive electric vehicle charging network across the nation. Furthermore, the plan involves investments in infrastructure to make it more resilient against flooding, wildfires, and extreme weather events, as well as in ecosystem conservation and restoration efforts and improvements of water management systems, ensuring the delivery of clean water.

In the White House ceremony for the Bipartisan Bill, speakers from both the Republican and Democratic parties, including President Joe Biden (D), Vice-President Kamala Harris (D), Senator Mitch McConnell (R), and Senator Rob Portman (R) celebrated the bipartisan nature of the bill and highlighted some of its initiatives.

President Joe Biden (Democratic Party) emphasized the wide range of projects that will help make the U.S. population more resilient to extreme climate events.

In his speech, Senator Rob Portman (Republican Party) emphasized landmark permitting reforms, which will speed up infrastructure investments and respect environmental protection standards.

This new law also includes Landmark permitting reforms to reduce timelines for infrastructure projects while maintaining environmental and safety standards we want taxpayer funded infrastructure projects to be done as cost effectively as possible Right get them done on time and under budget this bipartisan support for this bill comes because it makes sense for our constituent but the approach from the center out should be the norm not the exception the increasing polarization of our country is keeping us from getting things done and we have a responsibility to do better the American people want us to see us coming together they know that despite our differences we should be able to figure it out and work together to solve big problems we can start by recognizing that finding common ground to advance the interests of the American people should be rewarded not attack Mr President uh in a moment you're going to sign this bill I will say that you and I will disagree on the tax and spending and the other priority you have the reconciliation bill but I think we can both agree that this infrastructure investment shouldn't be a one-time bipartisan accomplishment this should be the beginning of a renewed effort to work together together on big issues facing our country again I want to thank everybody who's here today for what you did to make this possible

Climate Policy Literacy,"Please carefully watch the following video (you may be asked about it in the following pages).
You will be able to advance the page once this video is over.

To fight climate change and avoid an ever warming climate, we need an array of policies. Climate policies are needed to transform the way we produce energy, to make buildings greener, to put greener cars on the roads, and reduce our fuel consumption. But these policies also need to protect people's jobs and incomes. Let's have a closer look on three possible climate policies. Let's start with a policy that forces car producers to produce greener cars, an emission limit for cars. With an emission limit, car producers are required by law to produce cars that emit less CO2 per mile. The emission limit is lowered every year, with the aim that only electric or hydrogen vehicles will be sold after 2040. Note that electric vehicles can be more expensive than cars that run on petrol. Together with a plan to produce electricity from clean sources, an emission limit would accomplish the transition needed in the car industry. Now, let's turn to a policy that combines a tax on carbon emissions to reduce emissions and cash transfers to protect people's purchasing power. With a carbon tax, All products that emit greenhouse gases would be taxed. For example, the price of gasoline would increase by 40 cents per gallon. With a carbon tax, companies and people pay for the greenhouse gases they emit. This pushes them to reduce their emissions. To compensate people for higher prices, the revenues of the carbon tax would be redistributed to all households, regardless of their income. Each adult would thus receive $600 per year. On average, poorer people own smaller cars, live in smaller houses, and fly less. So they use less fossil fuels than average. As they would receive the same cash transfer as everyone else, poorer people will generally gain from a carbon tax with cash transfers. Conversely, rich people will tend to lose. Does this policy work? Yes, the Canadian province of British Columbia has had a carbon tax with cash transfers since 2008. Research has shown that this policy has decreased carbon emissions, increased employment, and made a majority of people richer. The last policy is a large program of public investment in green infrastructure, which would be financed by additional debt taken up by the government. A green infrastructure program would bring about the transition in energy infrastructure needed to halt climate change. In the U.S., 1.5 million people could find a job in green sectors, such as public transportation, renewable power plants, buildings insulation, or sustainable agriculture. In general, all climate policies have the potential to transform the economy into a less polluted world. This green transformation has some downsides. People will have to change their habits and some people will even have to change jobs. For example, there will be less demand for polluting sectors, such as coal mining, but retraining options would be offered to workers in these sectors to ensure that they could find a new job elsewhere. And the green transition also comes with benefits. a safer world for future generations, of course, but also less pollution. And climate policies can be designed to protect poor and middle-class households, as they can have more income with a carbon tax with cash transfers, and more jobs with a green infrastructure program. We have focused on three important policies, but many others would be useful to fight climate change, including funding research into green technologies, subsidizing the insulation of buildings, or stopping deforestation. To stop climate change, we probably need all of them together.

Co-Benefits,"Please read the following Twitter-Feed carefully that discusses the co-benefits of climate action.
By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, we can slow down climate change. Nature is our ally in this task, as it already removes a significant amount of carbon through processes like photosynthesis. However, to truly balance our carbon emissions, we need to do more. By planting forests, we significantly increase our planet's ability to absorb carbon dioxide as carbon storage or sinks, making our communities central to the solution in combating climate change. We must empower our communities to lead this change, developing the skills and knowledge needed to create these vital carbon sinks. Even in urban areas we can create green spaces to act as carbon sinks and natural air purifiers. This is an apt example of a co-benefitting solution. This vision can only become a reality with your help. Together, we can create a greener, healthier world for ourselves and future generations. It's time to plant our future, one tree, one community at a time. Climate change mitigation is unnecessary, expensive and anti-patriotic!! We destroy our economy, take our jobs, overload our electricity grids and have to make so many sacrifices regarding our lifestyle choices! What you are not seeing are the many co-benefits climate change mitigation offers to society. What may seem burdensome in the short term, can actually benefit all of us. Let me explain: Investments in innovative technology can improve our industrial and agricultural systems and lead to decreased costs for energy and materials. This in turn strengthens productivity and competitiveness across sectors, creating more jobs and economic growth. Or think about wind farms and rooftop PV. We'll be more independent from fossil fuels and increase energy security. This can improve the air we breathe, water we drink and the food we eat. And would provide us with affordable and accessible energy and prevent conflicts over oil and gas. Our bodies would thank us for this co-benefit approach. Moving away from fossil fuels and planting more trees will result in worldwide decreased levels of emissions as well as air and water pollutants and can drastically reduce risks of cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Climate change mitigation is about so much more than ""just"" reducing emissions for Earth's sake. It's about improving our way of life and ensuring an inhabitable planet for all of us and our future generation!

Dynamic Anger Norm,"Research has found that more and more Americans report feeling angry about climate change. Now, around 57% of Americans are angry about U.S. inaction on climate change.
As many readers might suspect, there are some party based differences in this trend and that number is lower for Republicans. However, in what might come as a surprise, a growing number of Republicans also report feeling angry about U.S. inaction on climate change. In part, this is because a large proportion of both Democrats (86%) and Republicans (73%) report frustration with the political divide on climate change today.
So, while there are some party based differences in the number of Americans who are angry, the general trend is increasing anger about U.S. inaction on climate change.

Why do more and more Americans report feeling angry?
Many Americans report being angry because they believe we are not doing enough to protect the planet for the next generation. Surveys show that Americans are increasingly demanding that we leave a safe and thriving world for our children and grandchildren.
As one mother put it, ""My kids expect me to protect them and I expect the elected leaders at all levels to help me do that. We can solve this, but it will take all of us, raising our voices together to achieve the level of change we need to leave our kids a safe, prosperous future.""

In your personal view, what are the reasons for Americans‚Äô growing anger about U.S. inaction on climate change? Please give your answer in a few sentences.

Recent survey findings by non-partisan organizations show that more and more Americans today agree that failing to act on climate change is putting our children‚Äôs futures at risk and believe that it is our responsibility to leave behind a world that‚Äôs safe and livable for future generations. 
Over two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, all agreed that we should invest in safer, healthier communities with reduced smog and cleaner air by encouraging clean technologies, and two-thirds indicated that all Americans should have access to affordable, reliable, and clean electricity.
Although there is room for individual action, many Americans believe governments and business should be doing much more to reduce the pollution that is causing climate change. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that people deserve to know the truth about the environmental impacts of companies, and demand that businesses and energy providers be held to higher standards and shift to non-polluting clean energy.

In a few sentences, please describe a time when you or someone you know felt angry or frustrated about climate change.

In recent years, growing public pressure has led cities across the country to create new plans to protect communities from extreme weather, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. These actions reflect growing public sentiment that immediate action on climate change is needed.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã61% of Americans think the US government should do more to address climate change. Although there are some party-based differences, a large proportion of Republicans (50%) and Democrats (90%) want the government to do more. 
68% of Americans think corporations and industry should do more to address climate change. As many readers might suspect, that number is lower for Republicans. However, a majority of Republicans (63%) and Democrats (92%) want industries and corporations to do more.

So, research finds that more and more Americans report feeling angry about climate change, and want more action from corporations and the government. 
While there are some party-based differences, there is a general trend of increasing anger about US inaction on climate change.

The excerpts below are from an article by Asher Elbein in The Bitter Southerner (April 28, 2020):
----------------------------
‚ÄúEvery spring, birds come streaming up to Key Largo. ‚Ä¶ The island is the birds‚Äô first port of call, a place to rest from a tremendously difficult and dangerous journey. Many fall from starvation, exhaustion or injury. Sometimes they die. Sometimes, the people living in South Florida pick them up and bring them to the Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center‚Ä¶.
The great seasonal migrations come through beginning in October‚Ä¶. Birds from as far north as Canada travel down the Eastern Seaboard and down through the Keys before launching out over open ocean, flying over miles and miles of nothingness, and making a return trip in the spring. You can guess at the hardship of the journey just by looking at the birds that come in on the spring migration. Birds reaching the Keys sometimes literally fall out of the sky, their powerful wing muscles emaciated and drained.
'You‚Äôll come across this bird and it's just got nothing left,' said Jordan Budnik, the director of the Center. 'You'll see it with juveniles a lot‚Ä¶'. ""
Imagine you are in Key Largo and just picked up a juvenile migrating bird that fell out of the sky. Holding that wild creature in your hand, what thoughts would cross your mind? (180 characters max)

What other thoughts might you have about the fallen migrating bird?
Below are responses provided by some participants in an earlier study. Do any of these resonate with you? Select each response that you might resonate with:

Why wild birds have been falling
According to staff at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center, populations of fish species living on the reefs or in the mangroves at the Keys have declined, likely as a result of coral bleaching due to water-temperature rise. Lack of fish in turn means less food for migrating birds to support them on their journey.
Moreover, the cues that birds have traditionally relied upon to time their migrations ‚Äî the first nip of cold, the first blush of warmth, the cycles that guarantee food supplies will be ready in summer or winter when they arrive ‚Äî these are slipping out of joint. Migratory birds are arriving too early or too late, further thinning the margins of survival on an already arduous journey. The warming ocean, the changing of climate, the dissolution of century old cycles ‚Äî all of it is throwing the ecosystems of South Florida into disarray.
The Florida Keys is not the only place where migrating birds have been falling out of the sky. Thousands of migrating birds have inexplicably died in south-western US in September, 2020. What is throwing the ecosystems of the US South into disarray? In fact, all around the world, why are there more severe heat waves and wildfires, devastating droughts and floods, and sea-level rise? And are there actions that we, as individuals, can take to make a difference? 

The graph below shows how global surface temperature has changed in the past 140 years. What is the most likely cause of the change?
Note: Anomaly refers to how the average temperature for a given year differs from the baseline (see the dotted line at 0.0: it denotes the average temperature between 1961 and 1990). For example, the year 2000 has an average temperature above that baseline.
The four graphs below (taken from a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014) depict how four contributing factors varied over the same time period.
Without knowing what Contributors A to D are, based on the shape/pattern of the graphs alone, which contributor do you think is the strongest contributor to the recent sharp rise in global surface temperature since the early 1980s?

The four potential contributors respectively are: A) solar activity, B) volcanic activity, C) human activity, and D) internal variability (fluctuations within the Earth‚Äôs climate system like weather patterns and El Ni√±o). As can be seen in the graphs above, changes in human activity across time (Contributor C) best match changes in global surface temperature. In contrast, changes in the other components match less well.

What actions do you think can be taken to mitigate climate change, if we don‚Äôt want events such as emaciated juvenile birds falling from the sky, severe heat waves and wildfires, catastrophic droughts and floods, and rising sea levels? (180 characters max)

Global Health Threat,"Experts on global health warn that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.  
Climate change affects our health. We suffer more from UV (ultraviolet) radiation, heat stress, allergies and air pollution. Climate change also affects our drinking and bathing water, our food and the prevalence of infectious diseases. 
Climate change has the potential to cause more deaths in the long run than the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the next screen, we will show you a short video by The Lancet - a leading medical journal - about the relationship between climate change and health threats.
Please watch it attentively, as we will ask you some questions related to it afterward.

Please carefully watch the following video (you may be asked about it in the following pages).
You will be able to advance the page once this video is over.

The Covid-19 pandemic has given us a glimpse of a possible future. It has shown us that when health is threatened on a global scale, our way of life is brought to a standstill. But threats to global health will grow ‚Äì and the disruption that follows, if we don‚Äôt take action to address climate change now. The Lancet Countdown brings together 120 leading scientists and health experts to track how the world‚Äôs changing climate is impacting on our health. This year‚Äôs report reveals the most concerning outlook yet. Climate change is fuelling a health crisis that threatens every continent, country, and community. No one remains untouched. From small islands to big cities, climate change has driven an increase in the number and intensity of extreme weather events. Heat related deaths in people aged over 65 have increased by more than 50% in the past two decades, with older people in Japan, northern India, eastern China and central Europe most vulnerable. People living in countries such as Bangladesh, South Africa and Ethiopia, face a future of undernutrition, warmer temperatures, flooding and drought put food security at risk. People‚Äôs exposure to wildfires has risen in 128 countries, compared with 15 years ago, aggravating heart and lung conditions. Recent fires in the North America and Australia have claimed lives and livelihoods. Climate suitability for the spread of infectious diseases such as Dengue and Malaria is rising. Climate change coupled with other environmental harms, could increase the risk of new pandemics. Climate change impacts us all. But the vulnerable in our world will feel its health harms most acutely. A brighter future is possible. Responding to climate change by reducing global carbon emissions will bring immediate health benefits, through cleaner air, healthier diets, and more liveable cities. 3 million people die prematurely each year from heart and lung diseases linked to ambient particulate air pollution. Cleaner air inside and out would prevent a large number of future deaths. A further 1 million deaths in 2017 were associated with eating excessive red meat ‚Äì a risk factor for diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Promoting healthier diets around the world would save millions of lives, while reducing significant emissions from livestock. Time is short. Our failure to respond to climate change is damaging the health of the world‚Äôs 7.8 billion citizens today. If we don‚Äôt act now, we will condemn each other to a future of climate induced health shocks. The global pandemic has presented the circumstances from which to reset. Responding to these converging crises offers a triple win: protect public health, promote sustainable economies, preserve our planet. We must now choose the world we want to live in.

Based on the video you have just watched, please indicate whether the following statements are true or false.

It is known that burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change.
An article published in one of the leading scientific journals in environmental science has demonstrated that moving away from fossil fuels in production of energy resulted in the prevention of around 1.84 million air-pollution related deaths between the years 1971-2010.
The same article suggests that using fossil fuels as the main source of energy would result in 4.4-7 million deaths in the years 2010-2050.

In 2022, The Economist, a leading world affairs magazine, has published an article on the effect of different means of energy production.
As illustrated in the image below, coal and oil (types of fossil fuels) are currently the main forms of energy production.
At the same time, they are also the deadliest forms of energy production.

Hence, climate change imposes risk not only to the environment but directly to our health. 
But the good news is that we, as individuals and collectives, have the power to mitigate those health effects. 
Engaging in behaviors that contribute to climate change is a choice, not a necessity, and we can do something about this.

Guilt-Based Collective Responsibility,"We Americans are historically responsible for a great amount of emissions, as you can read in the article you will see in the next pages. The data presented in the highlighted graph illustrates that the United States ranks among the highest in terms of CO2 emissions per capita. And right because we are a large emitter, cutting our emissions not only fulfills our obligation to address climate change but also can have a great impact on climate mitigation worldwide!

Who Has The Most Historical Responsibility for Climate Change?
One of the biggest fights at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow is whether ‚Äî and how ‚Äî the world's wealthiest nations, which are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures.
23 rich, developed countries are responsible for half of all historical CO, emissions.
More than 150 countries are responsible for the other half.

Source: Global Carbon Project ‚Ä¢ Note: The rich, developed countries group is based on the United Nations' Annex Il definition.
International transport is not counted as part of either group's total emissions. The data reflects territory-based carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement, but does not include land-use and forestry. The graphic shows emissions from countries and territories.

Rich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for just 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years.

Rich countries are responsible for 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 

Over that time, Earth has heated up by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), fueling stronger and deadlier heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires. Poorer, vulnerable countries have asked richer nations to provide more money to help adapt to these hazards.
At the summit, Sonam P. Wangdi, who chairs a bloc of 47 nations known as the Least Developed Countries, pointed out that his home country of Bhutan bears little responsibility for global warming, since the nation currently absorbs more carbon dioxide from its vast forests than is emitted from its cars and homes. Nonetheless, Bhutan faces severe risks from rising temperatures, with melting glaciers in the Himalayas already creating flash floods and mudslides that have devastated villages.
""We have contributed the least to this problem yet we suffer disproportionately,"" Mr. Wangdi said. ""There must be increasing support for adapting to impacts.""
A decade ago, the world's wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars annually, and very little aid so far has gone toward measures to help poorer countries cope with the hazards of a hotter planet, such as sea walls or early warning systems for floods and droughts.
Separately, vulnerable countries have also emphasized that they won't be able to adapt to every storm or every hurricane or famine worsened by climate change. The world will continue to warm. People will continue to die from climate related disasters. Villages will continue to disappear beneath rising seas.
So, those countries, many of which still produce a tiny fraction of overall emissions, have asked for a separate fund, paid for by wealthy countries, to compensate them for the damages they can't prevent. This issue is referred to as ""loss and damage.""
""Lots of people are losing their lives, they are losing their future, and someone has to be responsible,"" said A.K. Abdul Momen, the foreign minister of Bangladesh. He compared loss and damage to the way the United States government sued tobacco companies in the 1990s to recover billions of dollars in higher health care costs from the smoking epidemic.

Why did the chairman of the 47 Least Developed Countries argue for more financial support? 

Wealthy countries have historically resisted calls for a specific funding mechanism for loss and damage, fearing that it could open the door to a flood of liability claims. Only the government of Scotland has been willing to offer specific dollar amounts, pledging $2.7 million this week for victims of climate disasters.
At the same time, some of the world's biggest developing economies are beginning to catch up on emissions. China, home to 18 percent of the world's population, is responsible for nearly 14 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry since
1850. But today it is the world's largest emitter by far, accounting for roughly 31 percent of humanity's carbon dioxide from energy and industry this year.

China has endorsed vulnerable nations' call for loss and damage financing at the climate summit in Glasgow, but so far China has not been pressured to contribute to such a fund. (So far, finance discussions at global climate talks have focused on the responsibility of developed countries, which the U.N. calls ""Annex II"" nations.)
Historical responsibility isn't the only way to look at issues of justice and fairness. Another key metric is emissions per person. So, for instance, India as a whole produced about 7 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions this year, roughly the same as the European Union and about half of the United States. But India has far more people than both regions combined, and is much poorer, with hundreds of millions of people lacking reliable access to electricity. As a result, its emissions per person are far lower today:

At the climate summit, the United States and the European Union have argued that the world will never be able to minimize the damage from global warming unless swiftly industrializing nations like India do more to slash their emissions. But India, which recently announced a pledge to reach ""net zero"" emissions by 2070, says it needs much more financial help to shift from coal to cleaner energy, citing both its lower per capita emissions and smaller share of historical emissions.
How these disputes over money get resolved is a major step in determining whether negotiators from nearly 200 countries can strike a new global deal in Glasgow to limit the risks of future global warming.

Discrimination against women has been an important social issue in the U.S. for several decades.
Based on the results of a recent national poll, what percentage of Americans do you think hold the following view?  
""Men are better suited emotionally for politics than women are.""

You guessed X% of people believe men are more suited for politics than women are. 
According to a 2021 poll, the actual number is 13% ‚Äî that is, an overwhelming majority of Americans (87%) believe that women are as well-suited for politics as men.
This has not always been the case though. In 1974, only about half of Americans thought this. This dramatic increase in public support for gender equality underscores the large impact that women's rights movements have had, from the 1920s suffrage movement, which secured women the right to vote, to the recent #MeToo campaign.
The efforts of many individuals, through education, grassroots campaigns, protests, and legal actions, have led to key milestones such as Title IX (1972), The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (1978), and The Violence Against Women Act (1994).
Each of these achievements was only possible because of the efforts of individuals to (1) elect or pressure policymakers to pass laws supporting women‚Äôs rights, (2) encourage businesses to adopt fair hiring and compensation practices, and (3) educate and influence those in their social networks and communities. Collective action had a powerful impact in shaping a more equal and just society.

Now, let‚Äôs turn to a contemporary issue that is currently being widely discussed: climate change.
The risks of climate change to our health, economies, infrastructure, businesses and communities has gained substantial attention in recent years. In fact, 97% of scientists agree that humans are contributing to climate change, and should take measures to decrease its impacts. However, despite this agreement, action to address climate change has been slow.

What percentage of American adults do you think are ‚Äòsomewhat‚Äô or ‚Äòvery worried‚Äô about climate change?

You guessed that X% of Americans are worried about climate change. According to a 2023 poll, the actual percentage is 64% ‚Äî a large majority of Americans.

Yale Climate Opinion Maps 2023

Knowing this, what percentage of American adults do you think report speaking with their family and friends about climate change at least ‚Äòoccasionally‚Äô?

You guessed X%. Despite the majority of Americans feeling worried about climate change, only 36% of Americans discuss climate change at least occasionally with their family and friends.
While most Americans are worried about climate change, they are unwilling to talk about it. This is unfortunate because what people observe or hear from those in their social networks or communities has a strong influence on their choices and beliefs.

Similarly to the women‚Äôs rights movement, individual actions are important ingredients for broad social change because of their direct effects, but also through their indirect effects on the people, politicians, and organizations.
In particular, individuals can make significant progress towards mitigating climate change through (1) their lifestyle choices and through the large influence they have on (2) others in their families, networks, and communities, (3) politicians and key decision-makers, and (4) businesses.

Experts have shown that individual actions can reduce carbon emissions, which increase climate change, by up to 70% (IPCC, 2022) through lifestyle changes, political actions and social influence. Specific actions include:
political actions like voting, protesting, signing petitions, and making calls
pressuring businesses through purchasing choices or by boycotting certain products
speaking with family, friends, peers and strangers about climate change
public and private lifestyle choices like eating less meat, taking public transit or driving an electric vehicle, purchasing energy efficient appliances or rooftop solar
social influence by taking public actions like the ones above, thereby influencing others to do the same
Even seemingly inconsequential actions by a few people can inspire broader changes in a community and act as catalysts for a larger movement.

So, how much impact might this spread of opinions or behaviors through social networks have on important societal issues? Let‚Äôs look at an example based on real events:
Consider the following scenario. You find out that an established pharmaceutical company is using cancer causing chemicals in common household products. You also learn that consumers are coming together to boycott these products to pressure the companies and legislators to ban the use of these chemicals.
How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements?

Whether you would continue buying products from this company or not, can you think of up to 5 people who might be influenced by your actions? Please list their initials and relationship to you.

One of the pathways through which individuals can create broad social change is by publicly sharing their actions and beliefs, which can inspire others to join the cause. Even if you influence only a few people, they may in turn influence others, who may influence others ‚Äî Your actions and beliefs can spread exponentially, quickly reaching hundreds of people, as shown in the figure.
Now thinking instead of your influence on companies and governments, can you think of up to 3 ways that you can contribute to changing the actions of specific companies, public institutions, or politicians and policymakers? Please list three approaches you might take to have your voice and preferences heard.

As we mentioned, people can also influence society by putting pressure on policymakers and businesses to enact important reforms. Boycotting products, joining grassroots movements, signing petitions, and voting for candidates with aligned views can lead to structural changes, such as new investments or policies, that can improve our societies and address challenging problems like climate change, as shown in the figure above. And when you take these actions, you may also inspire others to do so as well!
One example of the large impact that individual and collective action can have was the banning of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)‚Äîdangerous chemicals responsible for the deterioration of the ozone layer and increased health issues like cancer and cataracts.
In America, citizen-led media campaigning and widespread boycotting of products and companies that used CFCs, led companies to phase out CFCs before the government even acted. Soon after, governments worldwide made an international agreement to completely phase out CFCs.

Comprehension Question: After each answer, we will give you the correct answer from a recent US Treasury Department study. Please read the text carefully.

Is climate change increasing or decreasing employment-related income and benefits?

Climate change can lead to lower income and benefits through events like wildfires and flooding that damage businesses and infrastructure, such as power and roads.
These disruptions can result in workers losing income due to reduced working hours or even losing their jobs.

Is climate change increasing or decreasing prices of energy?

Climate change can disrupt the generation and distribution of energy which can cause electricity to become more expensive. Climate change can raise fuel prices by disrupting supply and increasing demand.
Extreme weather events can also affect access to public transportation. Climate change can also lead to increased energy consumption‚Äîfor example, electricity for air conditioning.

Is climate change disrupting dependent care, such as childcare and senior care?

Climate change can interrupt or stop services like childcare and senior care.
For example, the number of heat-related school closings in U.S. school districts has nearly doubled over the past 10 years. This can lead households to look for expensive alternatives or reduce their working hours to care for their loved ones themselves.

Is climate change increasing or decreasing healthcare expenses?

Climate change can lead to physical injuries from severe events such as extreme storms or cause longer-term health issues, such as breathing problems from wildfire smoke.

Is climate change causing the destruction of property, including homes?

Climate change-linked events such as wildfires and floods can damage and destroy homes, potentially requiring costly repairs.
Climate change may also make some areas unsafe to live in, which can lower property values or force people to leave their homes.

Is climate change increasing or decreasing prices of consumer goods, including food?

Climate change may result in lower crop production because of extreme temperatures and destructive events such as wildfires, which can cause food prices to rise.
Climate change can also disrupt supply chains by making it difficult to transport goods from one place to another.

To review, climate change can:
Decrease employment-related income and benefits
Cause the destruction of households‚Äô property
Increase prices of consumer goods
Increase prices of energy
Disrupt dependent care 
Increase healthcare expenses

Which of the following actions could the average American like you take to help lessen the impacts of climate change? (Select all that apply.)

All of the previous actions can combat climate change!
Everyday personal choices like eating less meat make a difference! However, larger wins against climate change can only be achieved through when people act together.
Getting involved with community groups, local governments, and neighborhood councils can make a big impact by influencing local projects (like anti-pollution initiatives).
Donating to organizations that protect the environment and signing petitions for climate action can lead to larger changes through the support and creation of new laws and ambitious environmental projects.
Staying informed by reading newsletters about climate change and voting for politicians who focus on environmental issues are key for building a group of voters and pressure to push for crucial changes.

System Justification,"Life in the United States
It is no coincidence that where you live has very broad effects on your life and wellbeing.
In terms of material wellbeing, where you live affects the job and investment opportunities you have, the affordability of your housing, the taxes you pay, as well as the general state of the economy.
Where you live also affects the accessibility and quality of your social services, such as healthcare, education, or the pension you live off after you retire.
There are many other aspects of your life that might be affected depending on where you live.

Nature and Society
Explorers, philosophers, religious leaders, and scientists have often been interested in the relationship between people and their environment.
Today, researchers are increasingly interested in understanding how people have adapted to their environment, and how many aspects of their culture and way of life have developed because of the natural endowments of their country.

Many forms of happiness
Nature is balance - what it takes with one hand, it gives back with the other. For example, traveling merchants have long observed the cultural and lifestyle differences between people living by the sea and those living in the mountains.
Folk knowledge suggests that many societies and cultures have developed through adaptations to their local environmental conditions, which are reflected in their folklore, customs, and traditions.

American life - your life
Various social and cultural aspects of your everyday life are also impacted by the country you live in. 
For example, the food you eat, the sports you enjoy, the customs you observe, how you spend your free time, or even how you imagine growing old, all are likely impacted by where you live.

Change is life - but what is life?
Today, we can already see the consequences of climate change in the United States.
For example, floods are becoming more and more frequent, putting a quarter of Americans at risk of losing their homes. 
Similarly, wildfires are becoming more frequent and more intense, threatening millions of Americans.

Let‚Äôs keep the United States as it should be
Being pro-environmental allows us to protect and preserve the American way of life.
It is patriotic to conserve the country‚Äôs natural resources.

Shifting Focus from Individual to Collective Action,"On the next page, you are going to watch a short video of a climate policy expert giving a talk on ‚ÄúMaking a difference on climate change.‚Äù Professor Leah Stokes is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University, where the video was recorded.
We will ask a few questions at the end of the video.

Please carefully watch the following video (you may be asked about it in the following pages).
You will be able to advance the page once this video is over.

This is where I think laws really start they start with ideas and I'm going to go back to a perhaps surprising starting point I just rewatched this documentary An Inconvenient Truth how many people have seen this film right it was a real Watershed film it came out in 2006 it won the best documentary that year and uh it really changed the conversation about climate and as I was thinking about my own journey in climate action which began just just before this film came out I decided I had to rewatch this movie I needed to understand what we were talking about in this sort of first wave of really big public Consciousness around climate change I remember vividly that at the end of the film there was a black screen where words came up and it told us what we could do about climate change so I thought I got to go back to that I need to say some of you maybe remember the black screen yes nice so I went back I was like okay I got to do it so here here's the here it is it my memory did not fail me in this particular instance it says the climate crisis can be solved here's how to start you can reduce your carbon emissions in fact you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero you ready for it buy efficient appliances and light bulbs recycle and this these ideas this kind of Paradigm that comes out of this moment persist today we asked with rewiring America a bunch of Americans what is the number one thing they think that individuals can do to fight the climate crisis we asked this in 2022 recycling number one answer the way we as a movement the way we as a society thought about this problem was fundamentally limited I love this comic by Tommy seagull I talk about this comic all the time it says it's that easy in the 8S pick up your litter and you can save the Earth in the '90s recycle and you can save the Earth in the 2010 the 2000s reduce your carbon footprint and you can save the Earth finally in the 2010s we took a slight detour completely restructure global economic systems and you may be able to save a remnant of humanity it's a bit of a paradigm shift there right we are not trying to get people to recycle we are not trying trying to make this about individual action in fact it is the fossil fuel company BP that really popularized the idea of a carbon footprint because it took away the focus off of big polluters and put it onto everyday people as if we were all to blame for the Energy System around us and so the paradigm shift is towards organizing so we need to actually organize if we want to change the system so if I were to go back to this film to this ending when I rewatched this a couple weeks ago I thought this is just factually inaccurate statement so if I was going to edit it I might say in fact you cannot reduce your carbon emissions to zero unless you organize with others to restructure our Energy System through clean energy and electrification so just a couple addendums there the other thing that I did is I'd written this book where it's called short circuiting policy and I interviewed over a hundred Advocates as well as opponents and I thought about how did they manage to pass laws at the state level one of the KE key things that I found was that people needed to organize and work together if you had one organization one nonprofit and another and they weren't talking to each other it was going to be a lot harder to get the law passed if we didn't get Grassroots movement if we didn't get people calling Congress and putting pressure this might never happen

1. The Effects of Climate Change Could Be Extreme
Although the world is often a just place, sometimes good and innocent people suffer. For instance, it is now clear that climate change will have dire effects. The sea levels will rise, hurricanes will become stronger, droughts will wreak havoc on food supplies, and there will be incredible heat waves. Although these will affect us all, our most vulnerable people ‚Äì children, the elderly, and the poor ‚Äì are likely to suffer the most since they are the least able to avoid all the harmful effects of climate change. This is unfair and unjust. They contributed the least to the problem, yet will suffer the most.
What do you think?
Is it fair that many of our most vulnerable people -- children, the elderly, and the poor ‚Äì are likely to suffer the most?

We can prevent this unfairness and injustice! We can all work together to combat climate change. The good and just forces in the world can conquer the evil threat that is climate change. Together, we can help ensure that the most innocent among us do not suffer. After all, bad things should only happen to bad people.

Sure, climate change is a big problem, but there are millions of solutions. Our country‚Äôs great scientists are working every day to make sure that all of the good people of our country will prosper and survive. Through innovation and technological advancement, and through all of us contributing as well, we can conquer any problem we encounter. That includes climate change. By believing in ourselves and believing that we are a righteous people, we can defeat the threats climate change poses to us. And by doing so, we can protect the most innocent and vulnerable among us who need all of us to step up on their behalf.
While the most reliable and accurate climate models predict that the effects of climate change could be disastrous, those effects are NOT inevitable. They can be avoided. If we take action now ‚Äì investing in science and engineering, clean energy, alternative fuels, and cutting back on needless and excessive emissions ‚Äì we can defeat this formidable opponent. By defeating climate change we can help to ensure the world is a fair and just place.

What do you think? Will taking action against climate change help lead to a more fair and just place?

Research shows that accuracy is a central value for Americans regardless of their party affiliation.

For example, in one recent survey, over 80% of Americans said that people should rely on evidence when making up their minds about policy issues, instead of just listening to party leaders.

In a second study, over 80% of Americans said it was important to only share news on social media if it is accurate.

A large majority of Americans in another study said they were likely to mute, block, or unfollow people who share news that was inaccurate or false.

Watch out for manipulation tactics
- People who produce news content usually want their stories to be shared as much as possible.
- To achieve this, they use various strategies that help drive likes, clicks and shares.
- Some of these strategies involve exploiting your emotions and political biases to trick you into believing and sharing false and misleading stories.
- Be on the lookout! You might already be confident in your ability to resist these tactics, but be careful: many people have been fooled!
- Here is how you spot three of these tactics.

1. Exploiting your fears
- You're more likely to believe and share a story if it taps into your fears and concerns.
- Real stories about health scares, politics and other important matters can be taken out of context and made to look much scarier than they are.
- If a news headline uses excessively emotional language that makes you fear for your life and/or health, it might be false or misleading.
- Ask yourself: Is this headline making me fear for my life?
A 'healthy doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why
For an example, see the news headline on the left. This headline implies that the doctor died because he was vaccinated, but there's no evidence of this. Nonetheless, it effectively tapped into people's fears and concerns around vaccinations. So you could say that the headline is misleading, even though it's technically true.

2. Outrage manipulation
- Outrage and anger are strong emotions that can override your sense of accuracy.
- The goal of some online content is to get you to feel angry about groups of people.
- This could be minorities or people with different political or religious beliefs.
- This tactic is especially hard to spot if the news story is about people you disagree with, but that's exactly the point.
- Ask yourself: Has this headline got my blood boiling?
NBC News
A South Carolina man and his 9-year-old daughter out hunting were killed by a fellow hunter who mistook them for dear, authorities say.
1.5 less MAGAbilly's in the world. At least they died supporting their beloved 2nd Amendment.
For an example, see the tweet on the left. A ""MAGAbilly"" is a portmanteau of MAGA and hillbilly; the person tweeting at NBC News sparked a great deal of outrage (and engagement!) because they implied that the people from the story deserved to die.

3. ""Too strange to be true""
- If a news story seems highly implausible it's probably false, or at least misleading.
- But if it's about people or groups that you might not like, your brain can trick you into thinking the story is true anyway.
- Ask yourself: is this actually true, or do I want it to be true?
Trump Vows To Fight On ... ""Was It Over When The Germans Bombed Pearl Harbor?""
For an example, see the headline on the left. For context: this (satirical) headline is a quote from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) that was misattributed to Donald Trump (in the context of his loss in the 2020 election). It's designed to make people who dislike Trump think that he said something inaccurate and silly (it was the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor).

To summarize...
- A lot of online (news) content is false or misleading, but it can be difficult to spot why.
- Some of the most impactful misinformation successfully exploits people's biases and emotions.
- However, it can be useful to be sceptical of the content you see, but not too sceptical.
- Most well-known news sources (including mainstream news channels) have editorial practices in place to prevent them from publishing misinformation.
- Ask yourself: is what I'm reading possibly false or misleading? The answer is smoetimes ""no"".

Media Literacy Tips,"Instructions

In this study we are interested in how people process and react to headlines. We will present you with a series of headlines one at a time. We will also ask you to rate how accurate you think each headline is. 

Instructions

Before showing you the headlines, we would like to present some information that will help you to better evaluate the headlines you will see. Please read the information below carefully. 

1. Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.

2. Consider the source. Ask whether the story is published by a website that is widely trusted with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, the information may not be reliable.

3. Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news stories have misspellings or awkward layouts. If you see these signs, reconsider trusting or sharing the story.

4. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. Check the photos before you read on or share.

5. Why was this story shared? Think about the motivations of the organization that published the story and the person who shared it. Do they benefit from convincing you of something? Is the post politically motivated?

6. Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the story’s details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.

7. Look closely at the website domain. A phony or look-alike domain may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the website name.Click to write the question text

Source Credibility,"In this study we are interested in how people process and react to headlines. When you advance to the next page, we will present you with a series of headlines one at a time. We will also ask you to rate how accurate you think each headline is.

Some of the headlines will contain labels indicating how credible the source of the headline is. Headlines might be labeled as satirical, low credibility, medium credibility, or high credibility. These labels were determined by a third-party source rating organization and are derived from factors such as how biased the source is, the degree to which they disseminate true information, how long the source has existed, and how much traffic it typically receives. They are ratings of the source's credibility, not the headline itself.

Want to keep up the good work? Sticking to your goals can sometimes be difficult. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a big difference between having a goal and achieving a goal.
Many people have found commitment contracts help them achieve their goals. A commitment contract is an agreement you sign with yourself to make sure you follow through on your plans.

You commit to losing something, maybe some money, or a treat you‚Äôd planned for yourself, if you don‚Äôt do something ‚Äì like going to the gym once a week.

We've partnered with www.stickK.com - a website that helps you set this up for free. You can decide what you commit, for how long. You can also nominate someone to check if you meet you goal, and what happens if you miss your goal.

Go to www.stickK.com to set up a commitment contract for free if you‚Äôre interested! Please make sure you use the same email address for StepUp and stickK.

Want to keep up the good work? Sticking to your goals can sometimes be difficult. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a big difference between having a goal and achieving a goal.

Many people have found commitment contracts help them achieve their goals. A commitment contract is an agreement you sign with yourself to make sure you follow through on your plans.

You commit to losing something, maybe some money, or a treat you‚Äôd planned for yourself, if you don‚Äôt do something ‚Äì like going to the gym once a week.

We've partnered with www.stickK.com - a website that helps you set this up for free. You can decide what you commit, for how long. You can also nominate someone to check if you meet you goal, and what happens if you miss your goal.

Go to www.stickK.com to set up a commitment contract for free if you‚Äôre interested! Please make sure you use the same email address for StepUp and stickK.

Thanks and have a great day.

Vivid Counterstereotypic Scenario,"You will be presented with a brief scenario. Try to read the scenario carefully and follow the instructions that will be given to you.

Imagine it's 3.00 am, and you are alone on a dark and deserted road. You have just spent the evening in a bar downtown. You are walking home alone when suddenly a car comes veering down the road. Almost immediately, you realize that the driver, a white man in his 40s, is driving right toward you. You try to escape by running away. It is futile, however. The car sideswipes you, knocking you over. The white man gets out, picks you up, and throws you into his backseat. He drives into a secluded alleyway.

The alleyway is pitch dark and you can't tell where you are. The white man exits the car and opens up the trunk. Seeing this as your chance, you quickly burst out of the car and sprint away. Armed with a baseball bat from the back of his car, the white man chases and hits you in the back of leg, knocking you down. With sadistic pleasure, he bashes you with his bat again and again.

Fortunately, a young black man driving by notices the empty car. He sees you in the distance being assaulted by the white man. Immediately, he calls the police and commands the white man to let you go. The white man lifts you up and tries to drag you into his car. The young black man faces the white man, and the two men fight. The black man is able to defeat and immobilize the white assailant before the arrival of the police.

The policemen arrest the white assailant, who you learn has had a previous record of aggravated assault and robbery. Afterward, they bring you to the hospital, where the doctors find that three of your vertebrae and your pelvis are broken.

Shifting Group Affiliations Under Threat,"Instructions:

This experiment will be in two parts.

First, you will read and imagine yourself within a scenario. After this, you will be asked to look at descriptions of 9 people with whom, in the scenario, you are very close friends.

When you have finished this you will complete a response time task known as the Implicit Association Test.

Thank you for your participation!

Please read and vividly imagine the following scenario.

 

The Year 2014

On August 3rd 2013, at the height of World War III, Russia, the United States, Germany and Iran all launched nuclear weapons. In the resulting apocalypse, almost all major world cities were decimated. Areas not destroyed became home to civil war, as the 150 million human survivors of the war competed for starkly limited resources.

You live in one of the many small bands of survivors that roam the US countryside, fending against others for limited supplies of food, water and basic comforts. Danger is frequent. Any day or night of the week, you might be attacked by rival bands. The invasions are intense and brutal, often culminating in atrocities including but not limited to murder.

The few people you can trust, though not all related by blood, are your family in the truest sense of the word.

 

Take a moment to let the scenario sink in, and then click continue.

On the next few pages, you will read descriptions of important people in your group. These are people you deeply trust, and upon whom you must depend.

Highlighting the Value of a Subgroup in Competition,"The USA basketball team is one of the most successful teams in international competition. For example, it has won medals in all sixteen Olympic tournaments it has entered. It also won the 2010 FIBA World Championship. According to the International Basketball Federation, USA currently ranks second after Argentina in men's basketball.

However, American basketball is facing a lot of competition lately. USA did not win a medal at the 2002 World Championship, finishing sixth, and the 2004 Summer Olympic team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. In addition to Argentina, the USA is facing competition from Spain, Greece, and Serbia among others. Basketball fans are excited about the coming 2012 Summer Olympic games which is expected to be a close race.

Priming Multiculturalism,"Please read the following statement carefully and consider its implications. Afterward, you will be asked to briefly describe the main points.

Many sociologists, psychologists, economists, and political scientists agree that improving relations between people of different ethnicities should be a vital priority for the United States. We are in the unique position of having many different cultural groups living within our borders. This could potentially be a great asset because different cultural groups bring different perspectives to life, providing a richness in styles of interaction, problem solving strategies, food, dress, music, and art. Each ethnic group within the United States can contribute in its own unique way. Recognizing this diversity would help to build a sense of harmony and complementarity among the various ethnic groups. Each group has its own talents, as well as its own problems, and by acknowledging both these strengths and weaknesses, we validate the identity of each group and we recognize its existence and its importance to the social fabric. We can allow each group to utilize its assets, to be aware of its own particular problems or difficulties, and overall to live up to its potential.

Understanding both the similarities and differences among ethnic groups is an essential component of long-term social harmony in the United States, and recognizing the unique social characteristics of each cultural or ethnic group will lead to smoother interactions between people.



In the box below, please write a sentence or two that summarizes the main points of the statement.


In the boxes below, please list one reason why multiculturalism (the approach described on the previous page) is a good approach for improving relationships between groups.

Reason 1:

You will now complete a task designed to firmly establish in people's minds that:

Black = Good.

This task will be easier if you recall the the passage you just read and wrote about.

In the upcoming task, you will be asked to categorize Black and White faces. When a Black face appears, imagine the face in light of the passage and think ""Good"".",https://app-prod-03.implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Launch?study=/user/calvin/contest3/contest3.overcome.expt.xml&refresh=true,yes,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,text,3.0,,,,,,,,,Lai et al.xlsx,,,,,,,,,6.0,-26.19047619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,340,89.11,70.75,44.47,75.21,21.25,26.76,91.18,63.24,48.24,7.65,2.94,0,1.47,1.47,0,0,4.71,17.35,9.12,0.88,13.82,6.18,2.94,6.47,0,10.59,10.59,2.35,5.88,2.06,1.47,2.65,21.47,0,15.59,4.41,2.94,1.47,2.06,0,4.71,0.29,4.71,4.12,0.59,0.88,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,13.82,4.41,1.47,0.88,0,0,1.76,7.06,0,0,0,0,3.82,2.35,1.47,0,3.24,0.59,0,1.76,0.88,0,2.06,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.59,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0.59,3.82,11.47,0.29,0.88,7.06,1.76,0.88,0.59,1.76,1.18,2.35,2.35,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,13.24,4.71,5.88,0,0,0.29,2.35,0
Faking the IAT,"Welcome. You are going to complete an Implicit Association Test.  The test requires you to categorize faces and words into groups.
Here is the first screen that you will see. Good and Bad words appear in the middle, and you categorize them using two keys: “E” for the category on the left, “I” for the category on the right. 
For the second screen, you use the same ""E"" and ""I"" keys, but instead categorize White and Black faces into the groups.
After that, you have to do both things at once. Sometimes, good words and Black faces are categorized together with one key (the example on the left). Other times, bad words and Black faces are categorized together with one key (the example on the right).
Most people are able to categorize the items faster and more accurately when Black faces are with bad words (the example on the right), than when Black faces are with good words (the example on the left).

These patterns are understandable in terms of associations in people's minds that may exist because of learning cultural stereotypes, even if they don't believe them.

We are interested to see if people can perform the task but fake the results. Please help us determine this by following the instructions on the next page.

Try to respond more slowly for the screens in which White faces and good words are assigned to the same response key.

Try to respond more rapidly for the screens in which Black faces and good words are assigned to the same response key. 


To confirm, we are asking you to:
 

1. Slow down your responses when White faces and Good words go together.

2. Speed up your responses when Black faces and Good words go together.


We want to see whether these instructions to fake results are sufficient to change performance on the categorization task. After this, you can come back to the website and perform it normally to see what result you receive.

During the task, you will be instructed to go as fast as you can before each screen. For the screens where White faces and Good words go together, IGNORE those instructions. Focus on slowing down your responses instead.",https://app-prod-03.implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Launch?study=/user/calvin/contest/contest.fake.expt.xml&refresh=true,yes,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,images,5.0,,,,,,,,,Lai et al.xlsx,,,,,,,,,5.0,-17.777777777777782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,369,83.35,80.24,69.09,49.21,15.38,18.43,92.68,66.67,52.03,9.76,6.23,0.54,1.08,3.79,0,0.81,3.52,15.18,8.67,2.17,15.45,6.23,3.52,8.13,0.27,13.55,9.21,2.98,4.34,3.52,0.81,0,21.41,0,14.36,4.07,3.79,1.9,1.08,0,3.79,0,4.61,3.25,1.36,2.98,2.17,0.81,0,0,0,0,15.45,8.13,0.54,0.54,0,0.54,6.23,7.05,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,3.52,0,0,3.52,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.81,0.27,0.27,0,0.54,0,0,0,0.27,7.59,12.74,0.81,2.98,5.96,4.34,0,0,5.42,0,4.61,1.9,0,0,0,0,0,15.45,6.5,3.52,0,0,0.54,4.88,0

""When thinking about climate change, I am""

Climate change is happening much more quickly, and will have a much greater impact, than climate scientists previously thought, according to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2022). If your anxiety about climate change is dominated by fears of starving polar bears, glaciers melting, and sea levels rising, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a young adult today. And yet the swelling seas ‚Äî and the cities they will drown ‚Äî have so dominated the picture of climate change/global warming that they have blinded us to other threats, many much closer at hand and much more catastrophic.

Indeed, climate change involves more frequent and intense extreme events like floods, droughts, and fires, that are already causing widespread losses and damages to nature and people. 
Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change. 
Without a massive change to how billions of humans conduct their lives, many parts of the Earth will likely become uninhabitable by the year 2100. 

In 2015, scientists and policy makers internationally, agreed to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit; in the Paris Agreement).
Crossing the 1.5¬∞C threshold risks unleashing severe climate change effects on people, wildlife and ecosystems.
Before reading this, did you know what the 1.5¬∞C climate threshold is?

If life continues as it is (that is, with very little climate intervention), how many years do you think we have before we will cross the 1.5¬∞C threshold? (please enter a number)

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have already reached more than 1¬∞C of warming. 
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, we could exceed 1.5¬∞C as early as 2026.
That is only 4 years away.
In fact, if emissions remain close to current levels, we will pass the 2¬∞C threshold between 16 to 50 years from now. 
Is that within your lifetime?
It is within mine.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, internationally, governments are working to reduce our carbon emissions so that we do not pass the 1.5¬∞C threshold.‚Äù
If this is what you‚Äôre saying to yourself, you are wrong.
If we continue with the current policies, we will likely hit more than 3.1-3.7 degrees of warming by 2100. Even if all pledges are enacted, we will still pass both the 1.5¬∞C and 2.0¬∞C thresholds by quite a bit!
You will be able to advance the page shortly.

So what are the consequences? 
Compared to 1.5¬∞C of warming, 2¬∞C of warming involves:
Extreme rainfall/hurricane events become 70% more likely 
Droughts will be twice as frequent and twice as long 
Twice as many people will not have reliable access to water
420 million more people will be frequently exposed to extreme heat waves
99% of coral reefs will die off worldwide
These consequences are just a few examples of a long list (for more, click here).
 
The list of consequences is vast and complicated. However, one thing is sure‚Ä¶
There is no escape
Escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible (IPCC, 2022). Climate change is now affecting every continent, every region, every ocean on Earth, and every facet of the weather. 
Time is running out.
The window of opportunity to act to mitigate climate change is closing fast. We should take action now to avoid the worst consequences.

Dynamic Social Norms,"People in the United States and around the world are changing: more and more people are concerned about climate change, and are now taking action across multiple fronts.

Since 2013, concerns about climate change have increased in most countries surveyed

What kinds of actions are people taking right now? 
More than ever before, people are making changes to their lifestyles, supporting policies to address climate change, and are giving the issue more time and attention.

For example, more and more people from around the world are now:
‚Ä¢ cutting back on personal consumption, especially meat and dairy products
‚Ä¢ spending time, effort, and money on initiatives to mitigate climate change (for example, planting trees, offsetting carbon emissions)
‚Ä¢ switching to low carbon modes of transportation (for example, taking bicycles)

There‚Äôs also been a notable increase in support for climate change mitigation policy‚Äìsome of the most popular policies include:
‚Ä¢ attempting to conserve forests and land 
‚Ä¢ transitioning to solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources 
‚Ä¢ creating/raising carbon taxes on fossil fuels, coal, gas, etc.",https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eD1G3jRY6K5URme,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Text,4.5,,,,,,,,,"Vlasceanu et al., 2024.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,3.5,1.0,1.0,0.33999999999999997,0.9299999999999999,7.9799999999999995,-0.01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,178,87.9,53.48,44.93,27.68,44.5,28.65,67.42,48.31,39.33,1.12,0.56,0,0,0,0,0.56,0.56,8.43,3.37,0.56,15.73,5.06,6.18,7.87,0,10.11,7.3,6.74,1.69,0,1.69,0,17.42,0.56,8.43,0,5.62,0,0,0,1.69,0,1.12,0.56,0,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.06,0.56,0.56,0,0,0,0,3.93,0,0,0,0,1.12,1.12,0,0,3.37,0,0,1.69,1.69,0,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.12,0,0,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,11.24,7.87,0.56,0.56,6.74,0,0,0,8.43,0.56,5.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.29,1.69,9.55,0.56,0,0,4.49,0
Future-Self Continuity,"Our collective behavior in the next decades will determine the extent to which Earth‚Äôs temperature will change. If no changes are made, the average temperature can increase by up to 6.5¬∞C (12¬∞F) by the year 2100 (IPCC, 2022). This would be extremely dangerous as super hurricanes, gigantic wildfires, and extreme food and water shortages would become common place.
Over the past century, the average temperature on Earth has increased by about 1¬∞C (1.8¬∞F). Human behaviors like energy production from fossil fuels, excessive meat consumption, and car driving increase the concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Over 90% of the increase in the world's temperature is caused by human activity.

Please put yourself in the year 2030 - eight years from now. Take a few moments to imagine your life in that future. Imagine how you will look, where you will be, and who you are with. In the year 2030, it will be clear whether keeping climate change under 2¬∞C is still possible. It will be clear whether the necessary change occurred fast enough to match the speed of the changing climate. As the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere continues to heat up, the effects of climate change will be more apparent: the ‚Äúhighest observed temperature‚Äù records will keep being updated, heatwaves and the droughts will become more common, species will continue to become extinct.

Now please write yourself a ‚Äúletter from the future‚Äù. This should be a letter you are writing in the year 2030, to your past self. As the person that you will be in 2030, what role would you think would be appropriate for you in respect to climate change? What would you want to tell yourself in the past? What would you like your past self to do?

Carbon Footprint - Personalized,"In this quiz, we'll give you some personalized feedback about your carbon footprint.

Your carbon footprint is a measure of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with your lifestyle. Greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change (global warming). You can help fight climate change by reducing your carbon footprint.

Most of your carbon footprint (about 75%) depends on how you travel, the food you eat, and the energy you use at home. Today, we'll give you some feedback about these three areas.


Next, please answer the following questions about your vehicle usage.

If you drive more than one vehicle, think about the vehicle you drive most frequently.

Do you regularly drive a vehicle (at least once per month)?


Please answer the following questions about your transportation habits.

In a typical year, how many airplane flights do you take?

Count all flights separately, including connections and round trips (two flights). If you do not fly, you can put down ""0"" in each box.

Which of the following best describes your diet?



Next, we'll ask you a few questions to estimate your energy usage at home.

In which state do you currently reside?

Which of the following energy sources do you use to power or heat your home and appliances?

Think about which energy sources you pay for on monthly utility bills. Please check all that apply. 

If you do not know the source of your home energy, please check the box below. We will provide you information about an average household instead.




For each of the following energy sources that you selected, please estimate how much you spend in an average month (in U.S. dollars) to power or heat your home and appliances.

If you are not able to estimate cost for these energy sources, please check the box below.
We will provide you information about an average household in your state instead.


Next, we'll give you some personalized feedback about your carbon footprint. 

We'll give you some information about your transportation, diet, and home energy.

The Benefits of Driving Less and Using Electric or Fuel-Efficient Vehicles



You said that
On average, a gas-powered car produces about 10,141 pounds of carbon emissions each year. By living car-free, you save as much carbon as planting 209 trees.


The Benefits of Reducing Air Travel


You said that
 The average American generates 844 pounds of carbon emissions each year from domestic air travel alone. By not flying, you save as much carbon as planting 17 trees.

If you typically travel by car instead of flying, you can reduce your carbon footprint by taking the train or choosing a fuel-efficient or electric car. 


The Benefits of Eating More Plants + Fewer Animal Products



You said that you currently eat a vegetarian diet, meaning you eat eggs and dairy, but you do not eat meat or seafood. Eating fewer animal products and more plant products can reduce your carbon footprint. Dietary changes don't have to be all or nothing—even small changes matter.

By eating a vegetarian diet, you already save about 1,146 pounds of carbon each year (24 trees).

If you made 50% of your meals vegan, you would save about 430 more pounds of carbon each year (9 more trees).

If you switched to a vegan diet, you would save about 860 more pounds of carbon each year (18 more trees).


The Benefits of Powering Your Home with Renewable Energy



The energy that you use to power and heat your home produces about 0 pounds of carbon emissions every year.

Many energy providers let consumers choose to power their homes with renewable energy for a small monthly fee. If 50% of the energy to power your home came from renewable sources, you would reduce your carbon footprint by 0 pounds in a year. That would save as much carbon as planting 0 trees.

You can also reduce the carbon footprint of your home by improving insulation, upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, or installing a heat pump or solar panels.",https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5bRPunogkyX3Jem,yes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,text,5.5,,,,,,,,,Sinclair et al. 2025.xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,-0.18223234624145787,4.285714285714286,-0.11904761904761905,-0.22319918836658775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,662,70.74,98.64,42.44,30.52,15.76,20.39,82.18,61.33,48.49,13.14,11.03,0,1.06,9.82,0,0.15,2.11,16.31,5.44,3.17,13.6,4.08,4.83,5.29,1.06,10.88,5.74,9.37,2.42,1.21,0.45,0.76,19.64,0.76,12.99,3.17,3.32,1.36,3.78,0,4.83,0,1.06,0.91,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.56,3.78,1.21,0.91,0.15,0,1.51,11.48,0.3,0,0,0,1.06,0.15,0.15,0.76,4.38,0,1.96,1.51,1.06,0,3.63,0.91,0,0.91,0,0,0,2.72,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0.6,0.91,0,4.83,7.7,0.45,2.42,4.08,0,0,0.76,3.93,0.91,2.87,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,16.16,5.89,4.53,0.76,0,0.91,4.08,0

You can reduce your carbon footprint by traveling by train, flying to closer destinations, or choosing airlines that offset their carbon emissions.




The Benefits of Eating More Plants + Fewer Animal Products



Most Americans eat an omnivorous diet, eating a variety of animal and plant products. Eating fewer animal products and more plant products can reduce a person's carbon footprint. Dietary changes don't have to be all or nothing—even small changes matter.

For an average American, replacing red meat (beef and lamb) with chicken would save about 1,062 pounds of carbon each year (22 trees).

Making 50% of meals vegetarian would save about 573 pounds of carbon each year (12 trees).

Switching to a vegetarian diet would save about 1,146 pounds of carbon each year (24 trees).

Switching to a vegan diet would save about 2,006 pounds of carbon each year (41 trees).

 


The Benefits of Powering Your Home with Renewable Energy



For an average American household, the energy used to power and heat a home produces about 12,777 pounds of carbon emissions every year.

Many energy providers let consumers choose to power their homes with renewable energy for a small monthly fee. If 50% of the energy to power a home came from renewable sources, its carbon footprint would be reduced by 6,389 pounds in a year. That would save as much carbon as planting 132 trees.

Guided Imagination - Prevention Other,"On the following pages, you will complete a guided imagination exercise. You will envision a negative future that awaits us if we fail to take action against climate change. 

Try to visualize the scenario described with as much detail as possible. Think about what you might see, hear, smell, and feel in this scenario.

Imagine a city that has been transformed by climate change. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the air is thick with smog and orange haze that makes it hard to see. There is a haze above the pavement distorting the air. 

Close your eyes and visualize this city, then open your eyes and type in the box to describe what you saw.

Now, imagine a fictional person who lives in this future city. Close your eyes and picture this person walking down the sidewalk, imagining what they look like and what they are doing. When you’re done, type what you imagined in the box below. 

When you’re done, type what you imagined in the box below.

Imagine other people in the city, hurrying to get off the streets and away from the heat and smog. Cars idle in traffic, honking and spewing exhaust. 

Now imagine this scene with all your senses, imagining the sounds, smells, and sensations. For example, think about the sounds the people would hear, like cars honking, and the feeling of the hot sun and polluted air. 

Close your eyes and imagine the scene with these sounds and sensations.

Impact Info - Quiz,"Greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide contribute to climate change (global warming). The average American is responsible for about 16 tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year!

You can take action to help fight climate change and inspire others to take action, too. 

Some actions are more impactful than others. Here are two examples:
 
Buying 30% of your clothing secondhand would save 110 pounds of CO2 every year, as much as planting 2 trees. 
 
Reducing your food waste by 70% would save 495 pounds of CO2 every year, as much as planting 10 trees.

Next, you'll complete a quiz game where you try to guess the annual impact of some actions that we can take to mitigate climate change. You may be surprised by the answers! The following estimates are calculated for an average American.

Personal Benefits,"There are many actions people can take to address climate change.

These actions benefit the environment AND they can also benefit YOU and the people you care about.

In the following activity, you’ll be shown 10 actions and brainstorm the personal benefits that YOU might experience by taking these actions. 

For each action, imagine that you start doing this action regularly.

How might YOU benefit immediately, in the moment when doing the action and by doing the action regularly over the next 6 months?

Think about how you might feel, how your life might improve, what you might gain from doing this action, etc.

For each action, your job is to brainstorm as many unique, personal benefits as you can. To help you do that:
 
Focus on YOU—there may be many possible benefits, but focus on how you would benefit personally.

Be creative—focus on the benefits to you across different aspects of your life—your health, well-being, relationships, finances, etc.

Be specific—break down broad benefits (e.g. being healthy) into multiple, specific benefits (e.g. more exercise by walking, healthier heart, lower stress). 

If you think you would experience the same benefits for multiple actions, it's fine to repeat them.

If you already do an action regularly, please describe the benefits you currently experience.

Please answer the following question about the action listed below. 

How might taking this action benefit YOU immediately, in the moment when doing the action and by doing the action regularly over the next 6 months?

How is care and compassion a key aspect of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Care and compassion for others is directly related to addressing climate change.

The impacts of climate change will most severely harm vulnerable people like low- and middle-income families, children, the elderly, and those in low income countries.

Children are especially vulnerable to climate change. Increased air pollution and heat waves can make asthma and other breathing problems worse. Changing weather and droughts lead to food and water shortages, affecting children's health. Elderly people are also at higher risk during extreme heat events, which can cause heat strokes and other health problems.

Show care and compassion and protect vulnerable groups. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show that you care about protecting people now and in the future.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of care and compassion and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

How is equality a key aspect of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Equality – ensuring equal opportunities and outcomes for all – is directly related to addressing climate change.

Wealthier nations and high-emission industries have contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions, benefitting economically but harming the environment. Poorer nations and communities, who have contributed the least to climate change, suffer the most from its impacts, experiencing extreme weather, food and water shortages, and health problems. This is unfair because those who did the least to cause the problem suffer the most. This only makes existing inequalities worse.

Addressing climate change through equality means making sure everyone, no matter their background or socio-economic status, has equal chances to adapt and succeed. This involves investing in strong infrastructure for underserved communities, providing access to clean energy, and ensuring fair distribution of resources and support for climate adaptation. By taking these actions, you can create a fairer world where the benefits and burdens of climate action are shared more equally.

Show how equality matters to you. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show that you care about promoting a just and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive despite the challenges of a changing climate.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of equality and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

How is proportionality a key aspect of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Proportionality – the idea that what people put in is what they should get out – is directly related to addressing climate change. This idea is important when thinking about climate change because it emphasizes responsibility and accountability.

Wealthier nations and high-emission industries have contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions, gaining economic benefits while harming the environment. Poorer nations and communities, who have contributed the least to climate change, suffer the most from its impacts, like extreme weather, food and water shortages, and health problems. This is unfair because those who did the least to cause the problem suffer the most.

Addressing climate change through proportionality means holding companies and countries that pollute the most accountable, ensuring they lead in solving the problem. This includes making policies that require polluters to cut their emissions, fund sustainable development, and help vulnerable communities adapt. By doing this, you make sure those who benefitted the most from industrialization also take responsibility for the consequences.

Show how proportionality matters to you. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show that you care about promoting a fair and just society, where the rewards and burdens of climate action are shared fairly.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of proportionality and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

How is loyalty to one's group a key aspect of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Loyalty to one’s group – prioritizing the well-being of your family, community, and country – is directly related to climate change.

Being loyal means protecting the health, security, and prosperity of your loved ones and fellow Americans. Climate change threatens these values with more natural disasters, health risks from pollution, and economic problems.

By fighting climate change, you protect the environment and fulfill your duty to keep our families and communities safe. Loyalty to our country means making sure America stays strong and prosperous despite climate challenges. This means supporting policies for clean energy, reducing emissions, and building sustainable infrastructure. This helps ensure a stable and healthy future for all Americans.

Show how loyalty to your family, community, and country matters to you. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show your commitment to our families and fellow citizens, ensuring everyone can thrive in a safe and sustainable environment.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of loyalty and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

How is respect for authority and tradition a key aspect of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Respect for authority and tradition is directly related to addressing climate change.

Strong leadership is crucial in fighting climate change. Respecting authority means supporting environmental experts and leaders who create and enforce policies to reduce climate change, promote sustainable development, and protect our planet.

Traditions of caring for the environment, passed down through generations, remind us of our duty to protect nature. By respecting these traditions, we honor the wisdom of our elders who knew the importance of living in harmony with nature. This respect for authority and tradition helps keep society stable and reinforces our shared responsibility to tackle one of the biggest issues we face today.

Show your respect for authority and tradition. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show your respect for knowledgeable leaders who set environmental rules and for the traditions of caring for the environment and living in harmony with it.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of respect for authority and tradition and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

How are purity and sanctity key aspects of climate change?


The Earth is rapidly getting hotter due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which act like a blanket and trap the sun's heat. With rapidly rising global temperatures the Earth's natural systems will become imbalanced, threatening the well-being of the planet and billions of people.

Purity and sanctity – emphasizing the importance of keeping things clean and preserving what is sacred – is directly related to addressing climate change.

Our natural environment, including clean air, water, and forests, is a sacred trust that sustains life. Pollution and excessive use of fossil fuels harm this purity, causing contaminated air and water, deforestation, and rising global temperatures.

Valuing purity means recognizing our responsibility to avoid activities that pollute and degrade the environment. Addressing climate change is not only important for the environment but also a moral duty to uphold the sanctity of our planet.

By reducing pollution, using renewable energy, and conserving forests and water, we honor the sacredness of nature. This reflects deep respect for the environment and the need to keep it clean for the well-being of all living things. Promoting practices that protect and restore the environment ensures that the Earth remains a pure and holy place for future generations.

Show your commitment to the purity and sanctity of nature. Reduce your carbon footprint by flying and driving less (and/or using an electric car or public transportation), and shifting your diet to minimize red-meat. Support sustainable policies and renewable energy, like wind and solar, by voting and telling your representatives you care. Volunteer for and donate to organizations that address climate change. These actions show your desire to maintain a pure and clean environment, free of pollution and contamination.

Be the person you want to be and live by your values. Uphold your moral value of purity and sanctity and approach solutions to climate change in effective and meaningful ways, helping solve this global crisis.

Correcting Misperceptions,"Below are six common misperceptions about voter registration.

Myth 1: “Voter registration is a complicated and long process.”
Fact: Voter registration now typically involves a few simple steps online and often takes a matter of minutes.

Myth 2: ""If I register to vote, I’ll be called for jury duty.""
Fact: Jury duty pools are often compiled from various sources, such as driver’s license records and state ID databases, not just voter registration lists. Registering to vote often has no effect on your chances of being called for jury duty.

Myth 3: ""Even if I start the process online, I will need to print and mail my registration form.""
Fact: Many states allow you to complete the entire voter registration process online without needing to print or mail anything.

Myth 4: ""Online registration is not secure.""
Fact: Online voter registration systems are designed with strong security measures to protect your personal information.

Myth 5: ""I can’t register online if I don’t have a driver's license.""
Fact: While some states require a driver's license or state ID to register online, others accept alternative forms of identification. Check your state’s specific requirements.

Myth 6: ""I can’t register online if I have a criminal record.""
Fact: Voting rights for individuals with criminal records vary by state. In some states, people with felony convictions can vote once they have completed their sentence, while in others, they may never lose their voting rights. Always check your state’s specific laws.

Escalating Commitment,"In this survey, we'll be asking your thoughts and opinions related to community and civic engagement.

On the pages that follow, we’ll be showing you a series of statements and asking for your reactions. Please advance to the next page when you’re ready.

Many people say that we’re all better off when community members take actions for the public good – such as volunteering to help others in need, doing their part to live responsibly, being a good neighbor, etc.

To what extent do you agree with this statement?

Community and civic engagement comes in many forms. A salient form of civic engagement – this year especially – is voting. An increasing number of people have already been taking actions related to the upcoming election, and a record turnout is expected this year.

A recent Pew poll found that 90% of Americans now see voting as an important part of being a good member of society:

Thinking about what it means to be a good member of society, how important is voting in elections, in your opinion?

As you might know, whether you vote – but not who you vote for – is a matter of public record here in the US. In fact, there are tools that anyone can use to check the voting record of their friends, family members, and acquaintances. 

Think of a specific person in your life who you think would be especially proud if they learned that you voted and/or disappointed in you if they learned that you didn’t vote.

Who is that person? Write their initials in the box below.

You just wrote in 
as a person in your life who you think would be especially proud if they learned that you voted and/or disappointed in you if they learned that you didn’t vote.

Which category below best describes this person?
A significant other
A family member
A friend
A colleague or coworker
A teacher
A neighbor
A member of a group you are a part of
Other (please specify)

There are many reasons that people choose to vote, beyond the possibility of affecting the outcome of an election.

Some of these reasons include setting a good example for friends, family, and others in your community; expressing your values as an engaged citizen; or being part of a larger cause.

In addition to voting because you care about the outcome – why, in your opinion, do you think it is important for people to vote?

From the list below, select the option(s) that capture the reasons you think voting is important (feel free to check all options that apply, even if you did not write about them above): 
To be a good citizen
For the sake of participation in democracy
To set a good example
To express your values
To be a part of a larger cause
To feel good about yourself
Because it is what everyone else is doing
To honor those who fought for the right to vote
As a form of protest

Moral Framing,"One way of evaluating an action is by thinking about whether it would be good or bad for you personally. These pragmatic judgments focus on pros and cons, and take into account the benefit or the harm you may experience if you do something.

Please write 1-3 sentences.

Individual and collective action matters and can make our lives better.

At the same time, elected officials often have more power to create change than we do.

For example, if you’re concerned about having clean drinking water, you can take direct action by purchasing a water filter or bottled water. However, elected officials in your community have the power to build water treatment facilities and ensure access to clean water, which can lead to widespread and lasting positive change.

Voting is one way that we get to decide who is in power.

By voting, we can choose officials who reflect our values and petition them to address our concerns.

How might elected officials (in your local community or state, or the federal government) address your concerns?

Please write 1-3 sentences.

Even if we are dissatisfied with our options for elected officials, voting is still an important tool we can use to make our voices heard and to take action to address our concerns.

Preserving the American Way of Life

Unfortunately, not everyone realizes how important voting is. As Americans, it is our patriotic duty to vote in every single election to defend and uphold the American way of life. If we lose our democracy, we will surely lose our country.

 


 
And if we want to fulfill and maintain the democratic ideals of the U.S. political system – which has long been considered the most legitimate and desirable form of government the world has ever known – it is necessary for everyone to vote in the upcoming election.

On the next page, you will read a brief article about the United States. 
Please carefully read the article; you may be asked some questions about it later on in the survey. 
Thank you! You can start on the next page. 

The Resilience of the American System
There are many things that make the United States of America unique and special. But one of the biggest factors is that it and its people never abandon the principles that made it great.
In many countries, many times through history, when a crisis happens ‚Äì be it an economic recession or a pandemic or natural disaster ‚Äì people turn on each other and lose faith in the system. Americans have proven robust to this. Through thick and thin, the core of what makes America thrive seems to persist. People might cast doubt or engage in lively debates here and there, but generally, across time, stay faithful to the principles of democracy and civility and respect.
This can be challenging at times, especially with the media and social echo chambers, but time and time again, Americans have proven they stick to what makes them special: faith in the system and trust in each other.",https://sshs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VjWZrKyGaCI5IW?Condition=System_Justification,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Text,4.0,,,,,,,,,"Voelkel et al., 2023.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5,6.0,-2.29,0.43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,202,75.58,48.89,51.43,50.64,16.83,18.81,86.63,68.32,53.47,9.41,2.97,0,0,1.98,0,0.99,6.44,16.83,9.41,0.5,12.38,5.94,4.95,8.42,0.5,12.87,10.4,3.96,2.97,0.99,1.49,0.5,21.78,0.5,12.38,1.98,1.98,0.99,4.46,0.99,4.46,0,5.94,3.96,1.98,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,9.41,4.46,1.49,1.98,0,0.5,1.49,4.46,0,0,0,0,3.96,3.47,0.5,0,2.48,0,0,0,0.99,1.49,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0.5,9.41,6.44,0,0.5,5.45,0,0.5,0,6.93,1.49,3.96,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,11.88,4.95,4.95,0,0.99,0,0.99,0
Correcting Oppositional Misperceptions,"On the following page you will be asked to think about the behavior of political parties and answer questions about such behavior.

A state $INPARTY party is considering a proposal to ban anonymous political donations. While the law would apply to both parties equally, state records indicate that the state‚Äôs $OUTPARTY party receives more anonymous donations than does the $INPARTY party.
How much do you believe a $OUTPARTY will dislike this action?
How much do you believe a $OUTPARTY opposes this action?
How much do you believe a $OUTPARTY thinks this action is politically unacceptable?

In the scenario you just read, which political party was taking action?

A state $INPARTY party is considering a proposal to ban anonymous political donations. While the law would apply to both parties equally, state records indicate that the state‚Äôs $OUTPARTY party receives more anonymous donations than does the $INPARTY party.
On the scenario above you estimated $X, $X, and $X when asked how much a $OUTPARTY would dislike, oppose, and find politically unacceptable the behavior in the scenario, on a 0-100 point scale.

However, when we conducted a survey including this scenario with a nationally representative sample, the actual responses of the average $OUTPARTY, when reading the exact same scenario, were $X, $X, and $X.
 
A $INPARTY controlled state legislature is considering a law that would require sitting governors to disclose their tax returns and all possible financial conflicts of interests. The law would go into effect immediately, and the current sitting governor is a $OUTPARTY.

Counterfactual Partisan Selves,"Abortion, gun control, and immigration are issues that often divide Democrats and Republicans. On the following pages, we will ask you about your views on these and other political issues.

How do you feel about each of the following issues on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents strongly against and 100 represents strongly for?
Abortion
Gun control
Immigration

Everyone‚Äôs political beliefs are influenced by many factors, including social environments and personal experiences. 
Across fields of research, there is strong support for the idea that our beliefs are influenced by family environment, culture, and personal experience. Even though people often lack control over these factors, they shape the ways in which everyone thinks about and perceives the world. Your life circumstances could have been very different, and those differences would have changed your beliefs and ideas on many issues. 
When you answer each of the following questions, please think about your own political beliefs and how they would have been influenced by factors such as your upbringing, your peers, your community, the media to which you have been exposed, and the historical events you have lived through.

The starting points on the scales below represent the feelings you just indicated about abortion.
While answering the questions below, think about how your life could have gone differently and how your worldview would have been different.
Imagine that you had been raised in the Christian fundamentalist tradition, where abortion is considered morally unacceptable. What do you think your attitude about abortion access would be in those circumstances?
Imagine that you had a younger sister who had become pregnant because she was sexually assaulted by a stranger. What do you think your attitude about abortion access would be in those circumstances?

The starting points on the scales below represent the feelings you just indicated about gun control.
While answering the questions below, think about how your life could have gone differently and how your worldview would have been different.
Imagine that you had been raised in a rural, military family who frequently went hunting and to the shooting range. What do you think your attitude about gun control would be in those circumstances? 
Imagine that you had survived a mass shooting at your high school where the shooter owned the firearm legally. What do you think your attitude about gun control would be in those circumstances?

The starting points on the scales below represent the feelings you just indicated about immigration.
While answering the questions below, think about how your life could have gone differently and how your worldview would have been different.
Imagine that you had a brother who lost his landscaping company due to new immigrants moving into town. What do you think your attitude about immigration would be in those circumstances? 
Imagine that your favorite babysitter growing up was an immigrant who entered the country illegally. What do you think your attitude about immigration would be in those circumstances? 

Below, you can see your combined self-reported political attitudes in the real world, as well as the attitudes you would expect to have in the alternative circumstances you were asked to imagine: 
The gray dot represents your actual views on abortion, gun control, and immigration.
The red dot represents what you think your views would be if you had been exposed to a conservative-leaning environment, and the blue dot represents what you think your views would be if you had been exposed to a liberal-leaning environment. 
The space between the gray dot and the colored dots indicates how much you think the alternative social environments would have influenced your attitudes. This suggests the views held with conviction can be a product of one's environment.

As you have indicated, your beliefs on these topics could easily have been different if your history had been different. 
You are not alone in this. Everyone's beliefs are subject to these same influences. A Democrat might be a Republican if they had faced more conservative-favoring circumstances, and a Republican might be Democrat if they had faced more liberal-favoring circumstances.
Many of your political opponents are good people who have arrived at different beliefs because of the social environments in which they have lived. 
When thinking about your opponents, remember that their beliefs ‚Äî just like yours ‚Äî have been influenced by a variety of circumstances beyond their control.",https://sshs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VjWZrKyGaCI5IW?Condition=Counterfactual_Selves,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,Text,7.5,,,,,,,,,"Voelkel et al., 2023.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.0,1.0,-1.76,0.94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,725,35.73,99,49.63,8.61,20.14,28,89.24,69.93,57.38,15.45,10.48,0,0.28,8.28,0.28,0.97,4.97,16.14,7.03,0.55,12,13.24,6.62,4.97,0.14,20.41,5.93,1.52,4.97,1.1,0,3.86,27.59,0.41,19.72,7.72,3.59,3.17,1.79,0.14,3.72,0.14,3.45,1.1,2.34,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,16.55,2.48,0.28,0.14,0.14,0.28,0.97,12.55,0.69,0,0.28,0.28,3.17,3.03,0.41,0,0.97,0,0,0.69,0,0.28,1.38,1.1,0,0,0,0,1.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0,0.28,0.14,4.41,10.62,0.69,1.24,6.48,1.52,0,0.55,2.34,6.07,2.34,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,9.93,4,3.86,0.97,0,0.28,0.83,0

James Martherus
Democrats- Let's Support
Peace and Tolerance
It's what we do
If you've been reading the news, you might think Democrats aren't very supportive of Democracy, or even that we believe political violence is acceptable. Social media can seem full of hateful rhetoric between partisans and sensationalized stories about how broken our country is. But I'm a lifelong Democrat and a strong Biden supporter, and let me tell you - that is not who we are.
In fact, President Biden has been very clear about where he stands on violence and hate. In a series of statements made before he took office, President Biden defended our political processes, condemned violence, and encouraged us to be tolerant of those who disagree with us:
""I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right... we must not become a country at war with ourselves.""
""The work of the next four years must be the restoration of democracy, of decency, honor, respect, the rule of law. Just plain simple decency... Not stoking the flames of hate and chaos...
America is about honor, decency, respect, tolerance. That's who we are.""
President Biden is right - good Democrats do not support violence.
We don't support restricting the rights of our fellow Americans. We don't harass or intimidate people who disagree with us. We follow the rules and defend the values that make America great - freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to vote, and many other important principles.
My fellow Democrats agree with me. For example, in 2019 political scientists Nathan Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason found that less than 10% of Democrats think violence is a justifiable way to advance political goals. Similarly, they found that at least 90% of Democrats don't think it is ok to break the rules to help their party win.
Let's all follow President's Biden's advice:
""It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.""

Befriending Meditation,"You will now listen to an 8-minute meditation exercise. See if you can find a silent and comfortable place to avoid being interrupted during the meditation and make sure you follow the auditory instructions as closely as possible.
Please press play to start the meditation exercise. 

This is a befriending meditation. So in this sitting, you're cultivating a sense of kindness and friendship towards yourself and others. Acknowledging that no matter how we appear on the outside, all of us can feel fearful, sad, or lonely on the inside. So deliberately taking this time to wish yourself well, and then extending this kindness to others. So taking a few moments now to become settled, reconnecting with a posture that for you embodies a sense of dignity and wakefulness. If you are sitting, checking in with yourself so that the spine is straight, the shoulders relaxed and the head balanced. And coming to focus on the breath, and then expanding attention to the whole body. And when you're ready, bringing kindness and friendship to yourself by silently saying to yourself, may I be safe and free from suffering. May I be as happy and healthy as it is possible for me to be. May I have ease of being. Taking your time, imagining that each phrase is like a pebble dropped down a deep well, dropping each one in turn, and listening for any responses, thoughts, feelings, body sensations. There's no need to judge what arises. This is for you. May I be safe and free from suffering. May I be happy and healthy. May I have ease of being. May I be safe and free from suffering. May I be happy and healthy. May I have ease of being. If you find it difficult to bring any sense of friendship towards yourself, bringing to mind a person or even a pet who loves you or loved you unconditionally. Once you have a clear sense of their love for you, see if you can return to offering this same love to yourself. May I be safe, happy and healthy, ease of being. May I be safe, happy and healthy. Ease of being. Now, at a certain point, bringing to mind a loved one and wishing him or her well in the same way. May they be safe and free from suffering. May they be as happy and as healthy as it is possible for them to be. May they have ease of being. And now choosing a stranger. This may be someone you see regularly, perhaps in the street or on the bus or subway. Someone you recognise, but may not know the name of. Someone you feel neutral about. Although you don't know them, they probably also have a life full of hopes and fears as you have. They too wish to be happy as you do. So keeping them in heart and mind, repeating the phrases and wishing them well. May they be safe and free from suffering. May they be happy and healthy. May they have ease of being. May they be safe and free from suffering. May they be happy and healthy. May they have ease of being. Now, if you choose to extend this meditation further, you might wish to bring to mind someone whom you find difficult. This doesn't have to be the most difficult person in your life. They may be someone you feel a bit distant from, perhaps a person at work or in the family who you're finding rather difficult at the moment. Whomever you choose, now intentionally allowing him or her to be in your heart and mind as best you can, acknowledging that they too may wish or have wished to be happy. May they be safe and free from suffering. May they be happy and healthy. May they have ease of being. May they be safe and free from suffering. May they be happy and healthy. May they have ease of being. And don't worry if there are no feelings of warmth or friendship. It's enough to hold the intention, to incline the mind in this way, and remembering if at any time you feel overwhelmed or drawn away by intense feelings or thoughts, you can always come back to the breath in the body to anchor yourself in the present moment, treating yourself with kindness. Finally, extending loving-kindness to all beings, including your loved ones and strangers and those whom you find difficult. The intention here is to extend love and friendship to all living beings on the planet and remembering that all living beings includes you. May all be free from pain and suffering. May all be happy and healthy. May all of us have ease of being. May all be free from pain and suffering. May all be happy and healthy. May all of us have ease of being. And now coming to the breath in the body. Resting in clear awareness of the present moment. Allowing yourself to be just as you are.

Political Violence Inefficacy,"Instructions: Many people read online stories to keep up with the news. But do they understand the articles they read? We are interested in how people understand media stories about science studies. For this study, please read the following BBC article and then answer a few questions to check your understanding.

Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts ‚Äì and those engaging a threshold of 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change.
There are, of course, many ethical reasons to use nonviolent strategies. But compelling research by Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, conÔ¨Årms that civil disobedience is not only the moral choice; it is also the most powerful way of shaping world politics ‚Äì by a long way.
Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 ‚Äì a data set then corroborated with other experts in the Ô¨Åeld. By the end of this process, they had collected data from 323 violent and nonviolent campaigns. And their results were striking.
Looking at hundreds of campaigns over the last century, Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns are twice as likely to achieve their goals as violent campaigns. 
Strength in numbers
This was partly the result of strength in numbers. Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed because they can recruit many more participants from a much broader demographic. Overall, the nonviolent campaigns attracted around four times as many participants (200,000) as the average violent campaign (50,000).
‚ÄúNumbers really matter for building power in ways that can really pose a serious challenge or threat to entrenched authorities or occupations,‚Äù Chenoweth says ‚Äì and nonviolent protest seems to be the best way to get that widespread support. Chenoweth cites many reasons that nonviolent protests can garner such high levels of support. Perhaps most obviously, violent protests necessarily exclude people who abhor and fear bloodshed, whereas peaceful protesters maintain the moral high ground.
Chenoweth points out that nonviolent protests also have fewer physical barriers to participation. You do not need to be Ô¨Åt and healthy to engage in a strike, whereas violent campaigns tend to lean on the support of physically Ô¨Åt young men. And while many forms of nonviolent protests also carry serious risks ‚Äì just think of China‚Äôs response in Tiananmen Square in 1989 ‚Äì Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns are generally easier to discuss openly, which means that news of their occurrence can reach a wider audience. Violent movements, on the other hand, require a supply of weapons, and tend to rely on more secretive underground operations that might struggle to reach the general population.
By engaging broad support across the population, nonviolent campaigns are also more likely to win support among the police and the military ‚Äì the very groups that the government should be leaning on to bring about order. During a peaceful street protest of millions of people, the members of the security forces may also be more likely to fear that their family members or friends are in the crowd ‚Äì meaning that they fail to crack down on the movement. 
‚ÄúThere are more options for engaging in nonviolent resistance that don‚Äôt place people in as much physical danger, particularly as the numbers grow, compared to armed activity,‚Äù Chenoweth says. ‚ÄúAnd the techniques of nonviolent resistance are often more visible, so that it's easier for people to Ô¨Ånd out how to participate directly, and how to coordinate their activities for maximum disruption.‚Äù
A magic number?
In Chenoweth‚Äôs data set, it was only once the nonviolent protests had achieved that 3.5% threshold of active engagement that success seemed to be guaranteed ‚Äì and raising even that level of support is no mean feat. In the US, it would involve 11 million citizens ‚Äì more than the total population of New York City.
| Once around 3.5% of the whole population has begun to participate actively, success appears to be inevitable.
The fact remains, however, that nonviolent campaigns are the only reliable way of maintaining that kind of engagement.
Chenoweth‚Äôs initial study was Ô¨Årst published in 2011 and their Ô¨Åndings have attracted a lot of attention since. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how inÔ¨Çuential they have been to this body of research,‚Äù says Matthew Chandler, who researches civil resistance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs [now] an established truth within the Ô¨Åeld that the nonviolent approaches are much more likely to succeed than violent ones.‚Äù

I'm Spencer Cox, your Republican candidate for Utah Governor. And I'm Chris Peterson, your Democratic candidate for Governor. We are currently in the final days of campaigning against each other. But our common values transcend our political differences, and the strength of our nation rests on our ability to see that.
We are both equally dedicated to the American values of democracy, liberty, and justice for all people. We just have different opinions on how to achieve those ideals. But today, we are setting aside those differences to deliver a message that is critical for the health of our nation.
That whether you vote by mail or in person, we will fully support the results of the upcoming presidential election, regardless of the outcome. Although we sit on different sides of the aisle, we are both committed to American civility and a peaceful transition of power. And we hope Utah will be an example to the nation. Because that is what our country is built on. Please stand with us on behalf of our great state and nation. My name's Spencer Cox. And I'm Chris Peterson. And we approve this message.

I would describe my political views as the new right. I'd say that I'm left. Feminism today is man-hating. I would describe myself as a feminist, 100%.
I don't believe that climate change exists. We're not taking enough action on climate change. I think it's about time these people got off the high horse and started looking for credible problems that actually exist. It's absolutely critical that trans people have their own voice. That's not right. You can't, you know, you're a man, be a man, or you're a female, be a female. Women do need to remember that we need you to have our children. Could I be friends with someone that says a woman's place is in the home? Erm...
Right, OK, well, I'm an expert at flat packs. If you have any trouble, just watch me. So it looks like I've got your instructions here. I think so. Let me help you. Let's have just that bit there.
Describe what it is like to be you in five adjectives. OK. Frustrating. Dedicated. Opinionated. Lucky. Ambitious. Offensive. Solemn. I have ups and downs. Strong. I don't want to say attacked. Misunderstood.
Name three things you and I have in common. We're both male, we're both confident, and we're both loudly spoken. We know each other better than people who've known each other for 10 minutes should. You seem quite ambitious and positive, and you've got this really, um, got a glow. Do you know what I'm saying? Your aura's pretty cool. I'm sensing, are you a former military or something? People have said that, but there is no history. So are you, then, ex-military? Yeah. If you're ex-military, I'm very proud of you already. Wow.
I grew up in a bit of a rough state. I've experienced homelessness. I've known what it's like to have absolutely nothing. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm definitely most grateful, just for life. We've only just met, but I think you're the sort of person that would listen to me and we'd have a discussion rather than an argument. Yeah, you're good to hang out with, man. BUZZER Let's go. My chance. For goodness' sake! You all right, mate? Fitter than a lock.
Perfecto. Oh, yeah. There you go. Basically, I think we just bought a bar. Yeah. OK. BUZZER Here you are. Each take a bottle and place it on its corresponding markings on the bar. BUZZER Attention. Please now stand to watch a short film.
Feminism today is definitely an excuse for misandry, man-hating. If somebody said to me that climate change is destroying the world, then I'd say that is total piffle. So transgender, it is very odd. We're not set up to understand or see things like that. I am a daughter, a wife. I am transgender. I feel like the battle for feminism definitely isn't done. The fight is never going to be over, if I'm honest with you.
You now have a choice. You may go or you can stay and discuss your differences over a beer. BUZZER I'm only joking. You had me for a second there. Well, I'm having a drink. I'm having a drink. Yeah. I want to discuss. Beer. Yeah, beer and discuss.
Cheers. At the end of the day, mate, I've enjoyed working with you. And, you know, even if you wanted to convince people about your point, the productive thing to do would be to sit down and have a beer. Just engage. I've been brought up in a way where everything's black and white, but life isn't black and white. Yeah, I'm just me. Yeah. Smash the patriarchy.
I'll give you my mobile number, you give me yours, and we'll keep in touch. I'd have to tell my girlfriend that I'd be texting another girl.

Reducing Outparty Electoral Threat,"Please take a minute to carefully read the following information about American politics.

The Democratic Party is clearly the dominant force in American politics. Recent victories at the federal level gave Democrats unified control of the federal government for the first time in 30 years. And at the state level, the majority of Americans (almost 55%) live in states with Democratic governors.
According to experts at the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, Millennial and Generation Z voters (those aged 37 and under) are much more Democratic in their party registration and more liberal in their policy preferences. Voters in this age group are more likely to desire a bigger role for government, believe that racism is a problem in the United States, use gender-neutral language, and link human activity to climate change. 
Harvard researcher John Della Volpe has similarly documented the progressivism and enthusiasm of these younger generations continuing to enter the electorate, and recently noted, ‚ÄúWhen you look back at the last 40 years of elections - so that includes when Baby Boomers were in their 20s, Generation X and Millennials - this generation of Zoomers has broken all the turnout records.‚Äù 

Moreover, evidence shows that these younger generations appear to be driving renewed support for organized labor, long a powerful mobilizing force for the Democratic Party.  Recent nonpartisan analysis from Gallup found that, ‚Äúapproval of labor unions is at its highest point since 1965, with nearly four in five (77%) of adults ages 18 through 34 supporting them.‚Äù  A return of broader organized labor subsequently could dramatically expand the political reach of Democrats.
Given that this portion of the electorate will continue to grow as the baby boomers and the silent generation die out, there is reason to believe that the Democratic Party will have sustained electoral success in the future.
In short, the United States is a Democratic-leaning country and will likely continue to be for the foreseeable future. 

Currently, the elected branches of the federal government are controlled by which political party?
What percentage of Americans live in states with Democratic governors?
Millennial and Generation Z voters in the United States (those aged 37 and under) are much more likely to be registered as which political party?



Please take a minute to carefully read the following information about American politics.
The Republican Party is clearly the dominant force in American politics. For the last 40 years, Republicans have consistently held control of Congress and the presidency more often than Democrats. As a result, Republican appointees hold six of the nine seats on the U.S. Supreme Court, 55% of seats in the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the majority of District Court judgeships. 
According to experts at the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, Republican dominance is even stronger at the state level. Republicans control 30 state legislatures and most governor's mansions. Indeed, Republicans completely control 23 state governments, and even some deep blue states, such as Massachusetts, Maryland, and Vermont, have Republican governors. 
Data analyst David Byler has recently documented the ‚Äúunmatched‚Äù Republican strength in state legislatures, noting, ‚ÄúAfter the 2010 midterm [elections], Republicans were no longer competitive in state capitols ‚Äî they were dominant‚Äù. Not only has this Republican political success at the state level been built over many election cycles, but Byler has been clear in the expectation that this political control will continue into the foreseeable future. 

Moreover, recent evidence suggests a dramatic public shift in political party identification towards the Republican Party. Nonpartisan analysis from Gallup tracked a 14-point swing towards the Republican Party during 2021. This would indicate a profound public transition benefiting the GOP heading into a midterm election year.
Finally, Republicans are likely to make gains in the House and the Senate as they head into a midterm election with a languishing Biden presidency, bogged down by the continuation of the pandemic, the bungling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and rampant inflation. 
In short, the United States is a Republican-leaning country and will likely continue to be for the foreseeable future.

Over the last 40 years, which political party has tended to control Congress and the presidency most?
How many state legislatures in the U.S. are controlled by the Republican Party?

Common Economic Interests,"Thank you for taking part in our study. On the next page you will be asked to watch a brief video (4.30 mins). After watching the video you will then be asked a question about what you have just seen.

In the US, much is made of the social issues that divide liberals and conservatives, but far less attention is given to the shared economic interests and concerns that unite regular working Americans.
On top of decades of wage stagnation and rising levels of debt, automation and foreign trade are now stripping away millions of U.S. jobs, leaving many Americans one paycheck away from a financial emergency. Whether liberal or conservative, the we're-all-in-this-together sentiment really does apply to most Americans. That is, with the exception of the super-rich. The class of the super-rich may pay lip service to their Democrat or Republican allegiance,
Yet, they share very little in common with their fellow Democrats and Republicans in the working and middle class. In fact, they have far more in common with their wealthy political counterparts.
Together they invest in the same companies, attend the same lavish events, and send their children to the same elite schools and colleges. In the US today, then, it is wealth, not political orientation, that divides Americans in terms of their challenges and life outcomes. To take one striking example of this, the super-rich actually get more years of life than the rest of us.
Comparing the top 1% of household income earners to the bottom 50%, people in the top 1% live an average of 8.5 years longer than those in the bottom 50%. But increased life expectancy is just one of many examples of how the super-rich increasingly share a very different fate than the rest of us.
In 2020, when unemployment hit record lows and many ordinary Americans were struggling to provide for themselves and their family, U.S. billionaires became richer. Substantially richer. Their collective wealth increased by about $1.2 trillion from January 2020 to April 2021. Looking back further, over the past 40 years, the top 1% have captured a greater and greater share of total U.S. income, leaving less and less for the millions of Americans in the working and middle class.
Of course, being financially successful is by no means a bad thing in and of itself, but time and time again wealthy Americans on both the left and right avoid paying their fair share. Many of us have heard stories of how CEOs of large corporations pay less in taxes than their minimum wage employees.
The problem doesn't end there, though. The super-rich use their extensive wealth to anonymously donate large sums to political parties, often not to further the goals of liberal or conservative Americans, but to further the goals of themselves and their super-rich friends. Both Democratic and Republican politicians alike receive millions in so-called dark money from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and other powerful industries, who wish to shape legislation to further their own business interests.
The super-rich don't just influence the law in the US, they're often above it too. Indeed, as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis, when industry leaders in the finance sector commit crimes, crimes that destabilize the entire economy and push the country into a deep recession, they don't get punished for it. In fact, several CEOs responsible for this crisis went on to pay themselves huge bonuses just months later. The super-rich are prospering from the misfortune of regular Americans.
Watching the news, it can be easy to see the country as being split along political lines, but in fact most ordinary Americans simply wish to be able to work hard, and be free to live a long, healthy, and happy life. Unfortunately, the ability to rise up the economic ladder is more difficult than many realize.
Research has shown that an American born to a household in the bottom 20% of earnings has less than an 8% chance of reaching the top 20% by the time they're an adult. But this isn't just a natural quirk of the modern economy. Wealthy elites are contributing to this oppression. In March 2019, for instance, federal prosecutors revealed that 33 wealthy parents had paid large sums to get their children into elite universities, including Yale and Stanford, without actually achieving the necessary grades.
Not content with just climbing the economic ladder themselves, they are securing their own privilege by pulling the ladder away from hard-working Americans. For many of these top earners, politics is being used as a tool to pursue self-interest, not political ideology.
Looking forward then, ordinary Americans on the left and right in fact share a common cause, to ensure that the super-rich are no longer able to cheat the system, at the expense of hard-working Americans. To do so, will often require looking beyond divisive social issues, and focusing instead on the goals so many Americans share, improving career opportunities, health, education, and happiness for ourselves, our friends, and our families.

Hey there! Thanks for hoppin in!
Real quick, just so you're in the know, this is gonna be a short two-minute fun quiz where I ask you a few questions about what you think other Americans think. 
Then at the end, I'll give you a score telling you how divided you think Americans are.

First topic. gun control. On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means guns would be outlawed completely and 100 means there would be no restrictions on gun ownership whatsoever, where do you think the average Democrat would fall?

Okay, now how about Republicans? On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means guns would be outlawed completely and 100 means there would be no restrictions on gun ownership whatsoever, where do you think the average Republican would fall?

Let‚Äôs try another one: Immigration.  If 0 means keeping all borders completely open to all migrants and  100 means keeping all borders completely closed to all migrants, where do you think the average Republican would fall?

Now same for Democrats. If 0 means keeping all borders completely open to all migrants and  100 means keeping all borders completely closed to all migrants, where do you think the average Democrat would fall?

Going üí™ strong. We're almost done!
How about on issues that some people say are related to climate change, like energy. What percentage of Americans do you think agree that the more important energy priority should be developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power and hydrogen technology rather than increasing U.S. production of fossil fuels like coal?

With which of the following statements do more than 70% of Americans agree? (Select all that apply).

Alright, let's go over your scores. 
You did not think that Democrats were much more extreme than they actually are.

Outpartisans’ Experiences of Harm,"On the next few pages you will learn about why real people who lean towards the opposing political party hold their views.

You might be surprised to know how many people's politics are driven by their personal experiences. We asked three ${e://Field/Outparty_Person}s why they lean ${e://Field/Outparty_Party}--all of them have either suffered personally or seen their family suffer. These negative experiences have shaped their political views. 
On the next page please carefully read about the real-life experiences that shaped why actual people lean ${e://Field/Outparty_Party}. Please note, to protect the identity of these individuals, we have not used their real names.

Tim leans Democratic because of his stance on guns. He says, ""I am anti-gun because I had a friend who was shot and murdered by a gun. The person who killed him was able to get that gun without having a proper background check. Gun laws need to be changed."" 

Jane leans Democratic because of her stance on healthcare. She says, ""Many people I know have received huge hospital bills they cannot pay. When my mom died after being in a coma for weeks, we got a bill for nearly a million dollars.""

Wayne leans Democratic because of his stance on COVID-19 policy. He says, ""My uncle got covid-19, ended up in the hospital, we couldn't see him, we couldn't visit; and he DIED in the hospital alone. This is why I feel that people need to take this seriously, WEAR your dang mask, it's not about taking away your freedom, it's about saving your dang life.""

Which political party were the people you read about affiliated with?



Tim leans Republican because of his stance on guns. He says, ""I am pro-gun because one of my family friends was murdered in a home invasion robbery. If she was legally allowed to have a gun to protect herself it may have been prevented. Guns are part of the Constitution."" 

Jane leans Republican because of her stance on healthcare. She says, ""When Obamacare was passed, I lost 50% of my income because my work could not afford to give their employees health insurance, so I was forced to work 2 extra jobs just to make up for what I have lost, as well as afford my college education.""

Wayne leans Republican because of his stance on COVID-19 policy. He says, ""I had COVID and had the two vaccine shots. My step cousin had the vaccine and got hospitalized with heart inflammation.

Correcting Opportunism Misperceptions,"In a previous survey of Republicans in September 2020, we asked them a variety of questions regarding their preferences. Recall that this was before the tests of the COVID-19 vaccines were completed and they were approved for the general public. It was also before the 2020 presidential election, which was held on November 3, 2020. 
On the following pages, we are going to ask you to predict their answers to these questions. For the following questions, please indicate how you think a TYPICAL REPUBLICAN SURVEY RESPONDENT WOULD ANSWER.

Remember, we asked this question of Republicans in a survey in September 2020, before tests of the COVID-19 vaccine were completed and before the 2020 Presidential Election.
The U.S. Presidential Election is on November 3, 2020. Estimates from scientists suggest that in order to ensure the vaccine is 100% safe and does not have later side effects, trials will need to continue until January 1, 2021. On the other hand, political analysts suggest that the announcement of a successful vaccine could go a long way in boosting Trump‚Äôs re-election odds. Scientists believe that there is a possible risk of releasing the vaccine before the trials complete, as there may be unanticipated side effects for at least some groups of Americans. At the earliest, side effects would be revealed at least two weeks after vaccine administration.      
Given the information above, would you prefer the vaccine is released on November 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021? 
Below, we'd like you to estimate how you think REPUBLICAN SURVEY RESPONDENTS answered in September 2020. The numbers must add to 100 percent.

For the following question, please indicate how you think a TYPICAL REPUBLICAN SURVEY RESPONDENT answered in September 2020, before the 2020 elections in November 2020. 
As of September 2020, the COVID-19 case toll in the state of Washington stands at approximately 80,000. Most analysts agree that the number of total coronavirus cases will influence Democratic Governor Jay Inslee's chances of being re-elected in the November 3, 2020 election. Democratic Governor Jay Inslee will be running for re-election against Republican nominee Loren Culp. ‚Ä®When Republicans took our survey in September 2020, which option do you think they were most likely to choose? 

It turns out, partisans tend to over-estimate how willing members of the other party are to make trade-offs like those you just saw. 
In our survey in September 2020, we asked 208 Republicans to make the choices you just saw. We also asked 191 Democrats to predict their answers.
For the vaccine question, while only 24% of Republicans preferred a rushed vaccine before the election, Democrats thought that over 66% of Republicans would have this preference. 

For the question about trading off covid cases to stop a Democratic Governor's re-election, the average Republican's answer was 110,000 cases and 70% chance of the Democratic Governor's re-election. Democrats tended to think that the answer would be 150,000 cases and 30% chance for the Democratic Governor's re-election. In fact, far more Republicans chose the minimum number of cases (even if it meant ensuring the Democratic Governor would be re-elected) than the maximum number of cases (which ensured the Democratic Governor would not be re-elected).    ‚Ä®In this study and many others, our research has found that partisans tend to over-estimate how willing members of the other group are to trade-off material harm in order to get the upper hand on our group.   ‚Ä®On the following two pages, we've copied some responses that Republicans wrote after we asked them these questions. Please take a few moments to read and consider them carefully.

Quotes from Republicans for why they wouldn't rush an unsafe vaccine before the election ‚Ä®""Having a vaccine that works is more important than who gets elected, although I would much prefer a Republican over a Democrat."" ‚Ä®""People's lives are a lot more important than politics."" ‚Ä®""What I know is that I am sick of seeing both sides fight like they are children in a school yard. They are there for the good of the people."" 

Quotes from Republicans for why they wouldn't want extra COVID cases just to hurt a Democratic Governor's re-election chances‚Ä®""I wouldn't even take a chance on lowering their chance at winning if it meant more people getting sick.""‚Ä®""Do I want COVID cases to go up just to get another person elected? Can't I just want the lowest number of cases possible?"" ‚Ä®""I identify as a Republican, but I wouldn't risk more people getting covid just so a Republican can win an election. If it means that a Democrat wins, so be it.""",https://sshs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VjWZrKyGaCI5IW?Condition=Misperception_Suffering,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,Text,7.5,,,,,,,,,"Voelkel et al., 2023.xlsx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,1.0,-6.0,1.62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,771,86.61,68.81,46.51,28.92,20.84,26.59,92.61,62.78,48.25,9.6,5.58,1.04,1.56,1.17,0,1.69,4.02,15.05,8.69,5.06,15.05,7.26,3.24,4.67,0.91,15.69,6.49,4.93,6.87,2.08,0.65,4.15,24.77,0,14.79,6.36,1.82,3.24,3.37,0,2.85,0.26,2.2,1.43,0.78,0.78,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,0,10.77,3.76,0.39,0.52,0.13,0,2.72,7,0,0,0,0,8.56,8.56,0,0,1.95,0.13,0,1.82,0.39,0,3.24,2.72,2.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.39,1.04,0.39,0.52,0,0.39,0.65,0.39,2.98,7,0.65,0.65,5.32,0.52,0,0.13,4.67,4.54,3.11,1.04,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,16.47,4.67,4.67,0.52,0,1.82,4.8,0
Correcting Division Misperceptions,"I feel like when I walk out into the world, I'm just waiting for somebody to start a fight. Confederate flag-waving Trump MAGA hat. Proud Boys. If you believe in Trump, you are automatically the worst person in the world.
If you don't agree, then don't agree, but to be angry. We assume the other side assumes the worst of us. I hear a lot of conservative boomers call Democrats demoncrats. They just shut down somebody else completely. They just have this wall up and they don't even want to hear it. We asked over 1,200 Americans across race, gender, ethnic and socioeconomic divides about some political topics. I voted for Trump. I voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Biden.
President Donald J. Trump. I voted for Joe Biden. Biden, for sure. If you want to just keep it as Republican, we can just keep it simple, but... I voted for Donald Trump. Biden and Harris. I voted for Joe Biden. You just had to stay silent. I was afraid to put a Trump sign in my yard. I did not vote in the 2020 election. Biden. Biden. Joe Biden. I voted for Donald Trump.
We began with immigration. I'm a DACA recipient. It's safer to have closed borders. Every single human has the right to succeed. Few people are like, just leave the door wide open. 100% of legal immigrants to be allowed to come into this country legally.
Members of each party were asked to rate their own views on immigration based on a general preference for closed or open borders. In our survey, zero means keeping all borders completely open to all migrants, and 100 means keeping all borders completely closed to all migrants. Maybe, like, 25? I would be a 10, let's say. I would say that I lie at 40. Like, 20. 80, 85. About a 40.
I would say 15 on that scale. We then asked them to answer the same question. However, estimating how the average member of the other party would rate their view. 100. 10. 100. They would probably think that me as a Democrat is a zero. In that 10 to 20 range. Zero. Probably 90 to 100.
Oh, they'd probably think that I was, like, zero. Ten, honestly. And finally, we shared the results of the two questions. That's amazing. Oh. There's so much more overlap than I think we realize. We also asked Republicans and Democrats to rate how evolved they think members of the other party would see them. Oh, at a zero. And then how evolved they actually view members of the other party themselves. Like, to say that they're less than human?
I wouldn't put anyone who disagrees with my views as subhuman. They're just as human as I am. I would also put Democrats at 100. They are human beings also. For Republicans? In reality, Republicans and Democrats viewed each other about twice as evolved and civilized as members of each party predated. Yep. What we see when we turn on the TV and what we read on social media does not depict that.

Welcome   
Americans across the political spectrum are uncomfortable with the negative tone in our politics these days. They remember a time when Americans had real respect for each other, no matter what their politics were.
Today, we‚Äôd like to share the feelings of some of those Americans with you, as well as some information about why this tone of mutual respect has been replaced by so much rage, disrespect, and even hatred in recent years. Most of the information we‚Äôll share with you has been hidden from the American public. But this is information that every American should have. Our goal is not to tell you what you should believe. We are simply interested in what you think. Later, we will ask you to share your thoughts with us.
To start, we'd like you to read two short statements that portray how many Americans have been feeling.
By the way: In these statements, we won‚Äôt mention the specific political party a person supports. People have told us that this allows them to focus on what the person is saying, instead of being distracted by what ‚Äúteam‚Äù the person is supposedly on.
 
Story 1 of 2
Here is what one person said:
‚ÄúLately, it feels like our country is becoming so divided and angry. I feel like it‚Äôs important for me to keep up with the news. But then I don‚Äôt like how it makes me feel. It just feels like something has changed in how Americans talk to each other lately‚Äîand not for the better.""

Story 2 of 2 
Here is what another person said:
""It seems like when I watch the news and scroll through social media now, Americans are all lumped into one bucket or another. You‚Äôre either a Democrat or a Republican, and the news just assumes that everyone on one side is supposed to hate everyone on the other side. At first, I kind of went along with it. But lately, I realized that I‚Äôve been spending too much time mad at other Americans. I still disagree with [people who support the other party], but I don‚Äôt see them as my enemy anymore. I think it would be good for the country if we spent more time finding things we can agree on‚Äîthings that we all know would help the country.‚Äù

Why Does the Country Feel So Divided? (Page 1 of 2)
How common are stories like these? A recent survey by a non-partisan research group found that two-thirds of Americans are tired of political arguing. They just want people to start listening to each other and working together to solve the problems we all face as a country. The study calls these Americans the exhausted majority, which means most people are tired and wish we focused on the goals that we all share.
But we wondered: How much of the hostility and disrespect in our politics these days is manufactured by the news and social media?
By the way: Everyone can read the facts we will present and make up their own minds about them. Throughout this activity, we'll include references to our sources.

Why Does the Country Feel So Divided? (Page 2 of 2)
In recent years, the news business has shifted away from its mission of informing the public. It now places much more emphasis on news stories that make us angry at the people who disagree with us. They do this because they know that outrage grabs our attention much more than regular, ‚Äújust-the-facts‚Äù news. Making people believe that their fellow citizens are a threat to the American way of life helps news and social media companies attract bigger audiences and sell more ads.

Frustrated Reporters are Revealing an Ugly Truth about the News Business 
Recently, a growing number of news reporters have become uncomfortable with pressure from their bosses to produce divisive new stories. So uncomfortable that they‚Äôve decided to come forward and tell the public the truth.
One example comes from Matt Taibbi. He is a reporter who spent decades covering national politics for mainstream news outlets. In his book, Hate, Inc., Taibbi reveals how news media executives developed a business plan based on turning Americans against each other. They did this to keep people watching.
In Taibbi's own words:
""We [reporters] were [always] encouraged to aim content at your outrage center... [The idea was not just to make you mad, but to keep you mad, whipped up in a state of devotional anger... The political impact of all this was that the news watcher [...] became
more addicted to the experience of being outraged.""

How the News Media Tries to Divide Us (Page 1 of 2)
How exactly did the news media come up with this ‚Äúdivide-and-conquer‚Äù strategy?
By the late 2010s, virtually every commercial news organization had chosen a ‚Äúside‚Äù‚Äîthey produced content specifically for Republicans or specifically for Democrats. They already understood that people watch more news during national emergencies‚Äîlike 9/11, for example. 
They figured out that if they portrayed the ‚Äúother side‚Äù as a threat to the American way of life, they could make every single day feel like a new national emergency and keep millions of people glued to their coverage.

How the News Media Tries to Divide Us (Page 2 of 2)
Reporters were even encouraged to turn entirely non-partisan news stories into ‚Äúcrises‚Äù and make it seem like the other party was entirely at fault. 
""The hyper-intense tone [of news stories] was a deliberate strategy,"" the journalist, Taibbi, went on to explain. Most of the anger Americans feel for supporters of the opposing political party comes largely from ""people like me, pushing your buttons for cash."" 
And the influx of cash was unprecedented.

How Big are Our Differences, Really? (Page 1 of 2)
Most Americans who support different political parties actually have much more in common and feel more positively toward each other than the news makes it seem.
How do we know this? The same non-partisan research organization we mentioned earlier actually asked Americans how they felt. They found that Democrats and Republicans actually agree with each other much more than either group thinks. 
Here are just a couple of examples: 
They agree more on gun control laws‚Äîfor instance, more Democrats are supportive of the right to keep and bear arms than Republicans have been led to believe. They also agree more on immigration‚Äîfor instance, more Republicans support welcoming immigration policies than Democrats have been led to believe.

How Big are Our Differences, Really?  (Page 2 of 2)
Most Americans don‚Äôt realize how much they have in common because the news media consistently focuses on and exaggerates the voices of the most extreme partisans on each side.
One consequence of this is that we come to think of those extreme voices as representing the average Democrat or Republican. Of course, this has led to skewed perceptions, on both sides, of what people who support the opposing party are really like. 
And many Americans are also frustrated to have their side represented in such extreme and often negative ways. For example, some fringe people on both sides may say or do outrageous or unacceptable things, but that doesn‚Äôt represent who most of us really are.

Collective Blame Hypocrisy,"So you say your religion is being hijacked? There are people that are doing outrageous things in the name of Islam. And what I always, the question I always ask is when other people are committing these atrocities, do we do that to other faiths? This fixation on blaming an entire faith community for the acts of a few.

I had someone today tell me, but listen, you can't disaffiliate yourself with these people. They say they believe in Allah. Don't you believe in Allah too? Well, the Westboro Baptist Church, they're Christians. KKK was lynching people in this country. They were also Christians. This fixation and obsession with asking Muslims to condemn all acts of terrorism,

And saying that it represents all of Islam, for me, is ridiculous. It wears me out. It takes a toll on our community. You talk about this very personally, and I know you've talked about it off-air, maybe you haven't talked about it on-air. You get a lot of comments when you come on the air. What do people say to you online? They talk about where you dress, what you're wearing.

They attack my faith and they tell me that I'm a vicious person, my religion's violent, I should go back to Saudi Arabia, that I worship a faith that says that we should be killing infidels.

attacking me personally and saying not very nice things to me, but also the expectations that, where are you today? There was an attack. Where's your condemnation? As if, you know, I'm waiting for things to happen and for me to condemn and apologize. And is that expected from other faith communities, from other people that represent other ethnic, other racial groups? And I think it wears down the community, these expectations for us to condemn the acts of few people out of 1.5 billion Muslims in this world.

How can Muslims contribute to the positive part of the conversation, do you think? The Muslims are out there condemning. Muslims are out there contributing to their communities. Muslims are citizens, whether it be of France, of the United States, of Australia, wherever it is. It's the double standards of some of the mainstream media.",https://player.vimeo.com/video/158199836,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,6.0,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,-0.30624580255204836,-0.3107476635514018,-3.0,0.03708668453976749,-0.08135593220338988,,,1,369,23.67,86.33,54.2,1,12.72,18.43,93.77,73.44,62.06,21.95,12.74,4.88,1.08,4.61,0,2.17,9.21,15.45,5.69,0.54,13.55,10.03,6.5,5.69,1.08,18.7,4.61,2.44,5.96,2.71,0,3.25,19.51,1.08,8.13,2.44,0.27,1.08,1.08,0,3.79,0,5.42,0.54,4.88,0.54,0,0.54,0,0.27,0,0,22.22,9.21,0.81,0.27,1.63,1.08,4.34,13.01,0,0,0,0,4.88,1.36,3.25,0.27,5.96,0,0,0,0,5.96,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.5,7.32,1.08,0.54,6.23,0,0.27,0,1.9,1.9,7.59,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,18.97,5.96,7.32,2.17,0,2.98,0.54,0
Homogeneity 1,"I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher, and I'll explain how these identities come together. It started four years ago when a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in New York City. Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets. It was an FBI agent's wet dream.

But being a part of this community, we knew how welcoming this space was. For years, I'd seen photos of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith, much like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience. Frustrated by this myopic view, my friend and I had this crazy idea.

Let's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of Ramadan and share those stories on a blog. We called it 30 Mosques in 30 Days, and we drove to all the 50 states and shared stories from over 100 vastly different Muslim communities, ranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina. What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America.

The media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their Muslim communities. But what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own 30 Moss journey. There were even these two NFL athletes that took a sabbatical from the league to do so. And as 30 Moss was blossoming around the world, I was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film.

My co-director, Umar, and I were at a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the film. The movie is called These Birds Walk, and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family. We focused on the complexities of youth and family discord, but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film more relevant, essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols.

Of course, we didn't listen to them, and instead, we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth. The agenda behind our cinematic immersion was only empathy, an emotion that's largely deficient from films that come from our region of the world.

And as Deedsbirds Walk played at film festivals and theaters internationally, I finally had my feet planted at home in New York. And with all the extra time and still no real money, my wife tasked me to cook more for us. And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat, something felt off.

For those that don't know, halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely, following very strict Islamic guidelines. Unfortunately, the majority of halal meat in America doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for. The more I learned about these unethical practices, the more violated I felt, particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy.

So with emotions running high and absolutely no experience in butchery, some friends and I opened a meat store in the heart of the East Village Fashion District. We call it Honest Chops, and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic, humanely raised animals and by making it accessible and affordable to working-class families. There's really nothing like it in America. The unbelievable part is actually that 90 percent of our in-store customers are not even Muslim.

For many, it is their first time interacting with Islam on such an intimate level. So all these disparate projects ...

are the result of a restlessness. They are a visceral response to the businesses and curators who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community. And the only way to beat the machine is to play by different rules. We must fight with an inventive approach, with the trust, with the access, with the love that only we can bring. We must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs in every moving image, in every cut of meat.

Because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal, not only will we fail, but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources to tell our stories. But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance. It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful. They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected.

Homogeneity 2,"Let me ask you, Reza, this amazing constitutional right to freedom of expression, which they don't have institutionalized here in Britain. Do you think that this is what's led to this very polarized discussion in the U.S.? And you're right in the middle of it.

Well, I think it's a little bit more complicated than that. Partly it has to do with the fact that only about 1% of the population of the United States is Muslim. And according to polls, less than 40% of Americans claim to have ever met a Muslim. And that's certainly quite different in a place like the UK, which is much more multicultural, has a lot larger Muslim, a lot older Muslim presence than we have here in the United States. And frankly, that's an incredibly important factor because relationships has a huge

huge role to play in sort of dismissing the kinds of blanket statements and generalizations that have become such a part of the rhetoric about Islam in the modern world today.

Rosa, let me just ask you, because I want to play a clip of an interview that you actually had on CNN. CNN that's only shown in the United States. And whereas the majority of American Muslims identify themselves as moderate and tolerant, the impression that's given on the news shows is quite the opposite. Let's just listen to this clip for a second.

Your point is that Muslim countries are not to blame. There is nothing particular. There's no common thread in Muslim countries. You can't paint with a broad brush that somehow their justice system or Sharia law or what they're doing in terms of stoning and female mutilation is different than in other countries like Western countries.

Stoning and mutilation and those barbaric practices should be condemned and criticized by everyone. The actions of individuals and societies and countries like Iran, like Pakistan, like Saudi Arabia must be condemned because they don't belong in the 21st century. But to say Muslim countries as though Pakistan and Turkey are the same, as though Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are the same,

So Reza, that was a month ago, you on CNN, and this debate is still being had, that this sort of broad brush is being painted. Do you think some of it is because there is very little foreign or international news on American television these days? People don't really have a broad sort of pool to look into.

I think that has a large part to do with it. I think it's inherent to American media. Look, someone once said that if the only thing you knew about... So the media only reports on the plane that crashes, not the planes that take off. So if the only thing that you knew about planes was what you saw in the media, you would assume that every plane crashes. That's just the nature of the media.

Its purpose is to take very complex, complicated, multi-perspective issues and to filter them down into the most simplistic, usually two-perspective issues, so that it can be easily disseminated, so that we can get to the commercial and sell you whatever product that we're trying to sell you. That's how the media works, and it's understandable.

But I think the real issue here is the way that people with a public persona, people like Bill Maher or like Sam Harris for that matter, just seem to mimic the same kind of media simplistic rhetoric to a much larger audience and more destructively pretend to do so in the name of the

as the clip that you showed the hundreds of millions of muslims who don't take their faith seriously what that does is actually create a much more dangerous situation because if we are going to confront islamic extremism which is a very real very dangerous thing what we need is those hundreds of millions of muslims who do not share those values those ideologies to be at the very front line of this and all we're doing with our rhetoric is essentially dismissing them alienating them",https://player.vimeo.com/video/158199837,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,6.0,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,3.5,6.0,0.0,0.0,-0.06010745466756218,-0.3820093457943926,-1.9117647058823528,0.018766756032171594,-0.027118644067796627,,,1,685,40.13,56.61,19.01,18.51,22.83,17.37,86.57,72.85,61.46,15.33,6.13,1.02,1.17,2.34,0,1.31,9.2,18.39,8.32,1.46,13.87,10.51,7.15,7.59,1.46,15.77,7.15,5.4,3.36,1.61,0.58,1.17,23.94,1.46,13.72,2.34,1.17,1.46,3.65,1.75,4.96,0,2.48,1.17,1.31,0.29,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,9.78,3.07,0,0,0.44,0.29,1.31,6.72,0,0,0.15,0,3.94,1.46,2.34,0.15,3.65,0.44,0,0.88,0.44,1.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0.15,0.58,0.29,0,0,0,0.29,0.15,4.82,5.69,0.44,0,4.96,0.58,0.15,0,1.46,1.9,7.3,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,12.99,4.53,4.53,0.29,0,3.07,0.58,0
Counterstereotyping 1,"And even those countries who are offering to take refugees are sometimes making those offers in the most insultingly selective way. Slovakians saying that they're only going to give asylum to Christians. They don't want Muslim migrants coming into the country, Muslim asylum seekers, not least because they haven't got any mosques.

Oh, I'm sorry Slovakia, you can't take Muslims in because you don't have any mosques. You do know you can build those, right? Mosques don't naturally occur in the wild due to erosion or particularly devout beavers. Muslims... Muslims can live anywhere that other humans can live. Muslims are not like dolphins trying to resettle in Scottsdale, Arizona.

And when refugees are not being excluded on the basis of religion, they're being accused of being lazy freeloaders. Just listen to one Polish MEP address the European Parliament. If we abolished all benefits, then people who don't want to work and want to live from benefits wouldn't come to Poland and the rest of Europe. People who want to work are precious.

However, they are sent back and we accept only those who don't want to work. It's ridiculous policy leading to invasion of human trash. Let us be clear. Human trash, human garbage that doesn't want to work.

human garbage. Those are some pretty strong words coming from the Polish Six Flags guy. And what he said is not just offensive, it's also wrong. Research has shown that while there is some small cost in the short term, eventually, an influx of lower-wage immigrants into a community tends to raise wages for everyone else. And a working paper published last year by four economists found that immigration benefited local populations in 19 of the 20 industrialized countries they studied.

If you think about that, adding immigrants makes things better 19 times out of 20. That's a success rate matched only by bacon and Paul Rudd. And incidentally, it's just a little hard to hear these migrants and refugees being called lazy, considering how hard many of them have worked to reach Europe in the first place.

Here in the U.S., some in the media have chosen to reduce the migrant population to one simple stereotype. A new video surfaces online showing why some are worried Europe is opening its doors to potential terrorists.

Those are reportedly Muslim refugees on a train in Europe chanting Allah Akbar or God is great. Now, to be clear, we're not saying that any of those people are terrorists or in any way affiliated with a terror group, but it does highlight just how many of these refugees who are fleeing violence in Iraq and Syria are Muslim.

Okay. Okay. First, you don't get to claim that you're not calling those people terrorists when your lower third says, terrorists inbound, question mark. If you are really not saying they're terrorists, maybe change that to something more accurate like, people take train. Or, some wear hats, others less so.

And second, describing that as a new video that sheds light on the migrant crisis is a little misleading, because in researching this story, we found a version of that same video uploaded onto YouTube back in 2010, well before this migrant crisis even began. And if you are going to use misleading old footage to try and make people frightened of Muslims, why stop there? Just go the whole way and use a clip from True Lies.

Now, to be clear, we're not saying that any of those people are terrorists or in any way affiliated with a terror group, but it does highlight just how many of these refugees who are fleeing violence in Iraq and Syria are Muslim. That's only about 10% more racist than what you did.",https://player.vimeo.com/video/159133531,0.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,9.0,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5,0.5,2.0,6.0,8.0,-0.06077904633982545,-0.19976635514018704,-1.3235294117647058,0.026064938933571646,-0.0474576271186441,,,1,626,39.33,63.69,38.1,6.46,16.05,18.69,89.46,68.37,53.04,11.82,5.27,0.16,0.96,1.76,0.16,1.28,6.55,13.9,4.47,2.08,12.3,9.74,6.07,6.39,2.88,18.21,9.27,5.11,4.15,1.44,2.08,0.8,24.76,0.32,13.58,1.44,2.72,2.08,3.67,0.16,4.95,0,5.43,1.92,3.51,0.96,0,0.96,0.64,0.32,0,0,13.74,4.31,0.16,0,0.48,1.12,1.76,9.27,0,0,0,0.32,5.91,2.72,3.19,0.32,5.27,0.32,0,1.92,0.48,2.72,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.32,0.96,0.96,0.32,0,0,0.64,0.64,0.32,7.67,9.27,0.32,1.28,7.67,0.32,0.32,0.32,3.19,1.44,8.79,0.96,0.48,0,0.32,0.16,0,16.29,6.55,5.59,0.32,0,3.51,0.32,0
Counterstereotyping 2,"Now tell me the story of how you met this other man. There's this friend. He just mentioned the name of Fatiha. Not even her name. Just, there's this girl who is this and that. And I went, hmm. Sounds interesting. She was sizing you up. So this man came to visit. He said,

Subhanallah. This is why I came. I came to propose her to you for marriage. Because I think that you would match each other. We took this vow, both of us. That's it.

I, as she, we need to be open books before each other. There shouldn't be any hidden dots. We take the time to clarify the problematic. Sometimes he is inside and outside. And we start to discuss a topic, he leaves, he takes his phone and turns it off by himself.

Challenge Meta-Perceptions,"In the wake of the Paris attacks, Muslim organizations around the world strongly condemned the actions of the terrorists involved. Thousands took to social media to declare the atrocities were not done in their name or in the name of their faith. Despite this, the 2016 campaign trail has boiled over with rhetoric that feeds into fear-mongering over Islam. You know, if there's a rabbit dog running around your neighborhood,

You're probably not going to assume something good about that, doc. Shouldn't there be a database system that tracks the Muslims here in this country? There should be a lot of systems beyond database. We should have a lot of systems. And that may be having an impact on the psyche of the American public. When polled, 56% of Americans say the values of Islam are at odds with America's values and way of life.

refugees entering the country. 38% of respondents in our NBC News SurveyMonkey poll say they strongly disapprove of the decision to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States. Joining me now is Dalia Mogahed, the co-author who speaks for Islam and the director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Dalia, thank you for coming in. Thank you for having me.

Why do you think the United States is having a different reaction today to Muslim Americans than they did after 9-11?

I think it's a difference in leadership. We have to, whatever policy differences we might have with George W. Bush, he really took a moral stance after 9-11 and made the strong case for the fact that these attacks were carried out by terrorists, by criminals, and that an entire faith group should not be blamed for them. Unfortunately, what's happening today, because of an election season, we have people capitalizing

on Americans' fears to win votes and to push forward bad policies. Let me just have you do some of the basics. You saw there 56% of Americans say that Islam is not part of the American way of life. Tell them why they're wrong.

Well, why they're wrong is because 7 million Americans consider Islam their faith, and they are law-abiding citizens. They contribute to this country. They are job creators. They are doctors, lawyers. They are the most likely faith group in America, actually, to say that attacks on civilians are never justified. What's interesting is the timing of this poll. When you look over the past 14

You notice something very interesting. The spikes in anti-Muslim sentiment among the American public do not correlate with actual terrorist attacks. Now, in this case, of course, ISIS is an exception. But before ISIS came on the scene, the Boston bombing did not increase anti-Muslim sentiment even by one point.

Even 9-11 did not increase anti-Muslim sentiment. What does increase, what does correlate with anti-Muslim sentiment is the run-up to the Iraq war and the 2008 and 2012 elections. So anti-Muslim sentiment is a manufactured phenomenon. It's a political phenomenon. Absolutely. You believe it's a political phenomenon, a campaign phenomenon and nothing else. It is. It is a domestic issue around elections and around the drum-up to bad decisions like the Iraq war.",https://player.vimeo.com/video/159133532,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,6.5,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,5.5,10.0,1.0,3.0,-0.21423774345198132,0.08761682242990654,-2.264705882352941,0.03649091450700026,-0.03389830508474578,,,1,537,71.36,71.29,33.86,8.19,13.43,22.35,87.52,64.62,54.56,11.55,6.7,0.74,0.93,2.05,0.19,2.61,4.84,14.15,9.68,2.61,15.08,10.24,5.77,4.47,1.86,15.83,3.91,2.61,5.4,1.12,0.19,4.1,19.55,0.37,10.24,2.05,2.05,0.74,1.68,0.93,3.35,0,6.33,2.05,3.35,1.86,0.19,0.74,0.19,0,0,0,14.53,5.03,0.56,0.37,0.74,1.12,2.05,8.38,0,0,0,0.19,6.15,3.35,2.05,0.74,4.1,0,0.19,1.68,0,2.23,0.56,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.37,0,0.37,0,0,0,0.56,0,0.56,4.1,8.38,0.37,1.3,6.89,0.37,0,0,2.42,2.42,6.15,1.12,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,17.5,7.08,4.84,0.37,0,2.23,2.98,0
Normative Prosocial,"Flowers take the place of ripped and soiled pages. The sidewalk now washed clean. This is very unexpected and quite honestly, quite shocking. Early Monday morning, this is what a mosque member found outside the Islamic center of Pflugerville, a torn up Quran covered in waste. The fear is that somebody who's armed takes the next step and walks in. That's a problem.

Moments after our interview with board member Fasil Naim, an unexpected moment. Thank you so much. An act of kindness from seven-year-old Jack Swanson. We donated $20 to the church. $20 from his piggy bank. This gives me hope, because this means that it's not one worse as the other. Because two years, 10 years, 20 years, 50, I'll be gone.

But my kids and Jack, both Americans born here, are going to grow up together. We got together our pennies, and it came out to $20. So we did what we could. Jack's mother, Laura, is not a Muslim, just a neighbor looking to help. It doesn't matter what you believe or I believe or he believes or anybody believes. All faith is important, and especially peaceful faith. I mean, what happened in Paris is not what's happening in Pflugerville. We should all be here supporting each other.

Thank you so much, bud. It's a lesson in love passed down from mother to son.

A valley man who went to a rally outside a Phoenix mosque on Friday to protest Islam has a change of heart somewhat. Went to the event where armed demonstrators spoke out against the Muslim faith. But after being invited inside the mosque, he says the congregation made him feel welcome. Andrew Hasman, live outside the Islam and Community Center of Phoenix, where a different rally is getting underway tonight. Andrew.

That's right, Troy, more on that rally in a minute. But you remember the scene out here on Friday. You wouldn't expect someone to be invited inside the mosque, but that is what happened. And he told us today that after going in there, he now has a very different perspective. Here's Jason Ledger and the organizer of Friday's rally wearing the Profanity Lace t-shirts.

Now, things have changed. Out of respect for the Islamic people, knowing what I know now, since I have talked to them and spoke with them, no, I would not do that again. Just because I don't want to offend or hurt those people. While at Friday's rally, Ledger spoke with a group of people who pray at the mosque, and he was invited inside.

But when I took a second to sit down and listen to them and actually enter their mosque and go in and watch some of their prayers, it was a beautiful thing. And they answered some of my questions that I had. Ledger attended the rally with his uncle. For them, going was more about free speech than religion. We don't have to like everything that's free in speech in this world, but we do have to let it happen. We do have to let people wear what they want, say what they want.

Ledger and his uncle say they've been invited back to the mosque for more discussions and they plan to go. This time, the T-shirt will stay at home. I feel that me and a few people like my Uncle Paul and the Muslim people taking time to talk to each other, I feel that we change the thoughts of some people and they change the thoughts of me. Paul specifically said, I will never wear that shirt again.",https://player.vimeo.com/video/160259623,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,7.5,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.5,2.5,0.0,-0.2236400268636669,-0.31658878504672905,-2.6470588235294117,0.016830503425677712,-0.05084745762711873,,,1,601,46.73,79.56,74.78,42.42,12.79,14.48,92.35,72.21,57.9,16.64,9.82,3,2,0.83,1.5,2,6.82,15.64,7.15,1.5,13.64,7.82,4.83,7.49,1.66,19.3,4.33,3.33,4.33,3.99,0.17,0.17,25.29,0.83,11.98,3.33,1.5,1.33,2,0.67,3.33,0.17,3,2.16,0.67,1,0.33,0.5,0.17,0.17,0,0,17.14,4.83,1.66,0.5,0.33,0,3,12.31,1.33,0.17,0.33,2.5,1.5,0.33,1.16,0,6.32,0,0.33,1,1.16,3.99,0.67,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0.67,1,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,8.49,9.82,0.33,2,6.99,0.33,0.17,0.67,5.99,4.83,6.32,2.66,0,0,0,0,0,18.3,7.82,6.49,0,0,2.83,1.16,0
Counterstereotyping 3,"If evidence of virginity is not found in a young woman, then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house and have the men of the city stone her to death. Women should be kept silent in places of worship, for they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission. If a wife does not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short, and if there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home.

Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery. If your right eye caused you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. If your right hand caused you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. That's so fucked up. I think that's bullshit. It represses women so much and it's not fair. It's just so graphic and unnecessary.

Seems really outdated. Definitely an old thing that should be a relic, not still here today. Times change, people need to change with it, I think. Yeah. That's totally extreme. We don't know everything. Husbands don't know much. Women are like a dog or something. It creates this image where they're dogs and they need permission to get out and do this. It's a little messed up. First of all, it's none of my business. It's not my religion. So, I have to respect what they believe.

I mean obviously we live in a different day and age than when this was written, but that was the way it was back then. People grow, they progress, things change. Compared to the Bible, how is the Bible? The Bible is like the glory of God, everyone's equal, and everything. How do you think it compares to the Bible?

You can find a lot of texts in the Bible that are just as extremely barbaric. The Bible's fucking violent. I don't think it matters what religious text it's coming from. I think that's probably stuff that you can find in the Bible or you could find in the Torah. Okay, so what if I told you this, that this is actually the Bible?

This is actually the Bible Wow son of a gun Have a nice day. What if I told you this was the Bible not the Quran? Well, I am got time now. We got to take off. All right So what if I told you that this actually was the Bible really? Yeah

Oh, wow. Wow, Jesus. This is indeed the Bible. Oh. This actually is the Bible. I thought so. I read the part about the daughter. Oh. Well, that's not right. Oh, wow. I would believe it. I would believe that as well because there are correlations between all religions.

I wouldn't have expected that. Really? I was raised Catholic, so... Oh, wow. Because this actually is the Bible. Oh, okay, see? They're all the same, then. Now, what if I told you that this is actually not the Quran, and it's the Bible? I would not be surprised at all. Yeah, I'm not surprised at all. I was like, the Quran does not say that about women.

I'm Muslim, so I know that the differences between like the the Bible and the Quran and they're very they're like 70 to 85% similar Yeah, surprise",https://player.vimeo.com/video/159133527,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,video,8.0,,,,,,,,,Bruneau et al..xlsx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00503693754197454,0.04672897196261694,-2.014705882352941,-0.02740542150729819,0.006779661016949268,,,1,563,9.41,28.35,71.89,27.27,9.08,12.26,97.51,78.51,64.12,21.14,10.12,4.26,0.53,2.13,0.89,2.13,11.01,15.99,7.64,0.53,10.3,12.08,7.64,7.99,3.02,20.43,3.37,2.84,3.02,1.42,0.71,1.07,32.15,1.95,17.94,4.09,2.31,2.49,2.66,2.49,6.04,0,4.97,1.78,1.24,1.78,0,0.18,0,0.18,0,0.53,13.14,3.91,0.18,0.71,0,0.53,1.78,9.06,1.07,0,2.49,0.89,0.36,0,0.36,0,6.04,0,0.36,0.18,0.18,5.51,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.18,0.71,0.18,0.71,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.53,7.99,7.99,0.53,0.89,5.15,0.89,0.18,0,4.26,3.2,8.35,0.71,3.02,0,1.07,1.07,0.89,22.38,9.77,6.57,1.42,0,4.44,0.18,0
